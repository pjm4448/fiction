The air within the colossal temple of Ur-Kthos hangs heavy as molten lead: a suffocating brew of lotus fumes, the musk of sweating flesh, and the sharp, iron tang heralding the Great Serpent's awakening. My skin, anointed with sacred oils and scrawled with the god's sinuous sigils, prickles with unholy fire. Around me, the chosen of Ur-Kthos sway like reeds in a storm, driven by the thunderous pulse of skin drums, their voices a wild, keening wail that claws at the ancient stones of this primordial fane. I recall my first offering, the trembling of my hands before they learned to revel in the blood's warmth.

I, among the Favored, feel my soul blaze with the black lotus's sorcery and the molten wine coursing through my veins like the ichor of gods. My silken raiment, studded with glinting jewels, clings to my flesh like a lover's caress, shimmering in the fitful torchlight. Monstrous shadows dance upon walls graven with the deeds of Ur-Kthos: devourer of stars, consort of forgotten goddesses, and dread sovereign demanding the fealty of his flock. Tonight, pleasure becomes our prayer, each touch a sacrament, each moan a paean to the Serpent's glory.

At the hall's heart, temple dancers writhe in primal ecstasy. Lithe as vipers and adorned with glittering gems and the fangs of sacred serpents, their movements weave a spell of raw sensation, promising the sweet oblivion that Ur-Kthos grants to those who yield utterly to his will. My heart thunders in time with the drums, the god's presence coiling within me: a delicious, dread power that sets my blood aflame.

Yet the true climax, the moment my soul craves like a beast for blood, looms yet unborn.

The chant deepens, a hungry growl rising in the throats of the faithful. The temple's iron-bound doors groan wide, and the Unbeliever is dragged forth: a fair maid from some soft, civilized city that dares scorn the old gods. Stripped naked, her struggles only bare the smooth, unmarred perfection of her form against the altar's rough-hewn stone. Her fear rises like heady incense, a sharp counterpoint to the cloying ecstasy of the devout.

Her breasts, full and ripe, rise proudly from her heaving chest: twin creamy orbs defying the pull of the earth with their buoyant perfection. Her nipples, rosy and taut with chill and terror, stand like tender buds ripe for the plucking. As she writhes upon the cold altar, those soft globes quiver, a feast for ravenous eyes, stirring a hunger that sets my mouth watering. Between her trembling thighs blooms the glistening petals of her virgin flower. Her slender legs thrash against their bonds, parting the delicate lips of her sex to reveal the moist, unsullied slit within. The sweet reek of her fear mingles with the musky scent of her womanhood, a potent elixir that fans the lust of the faithful to a roaring blaze.

Her terror is no mere sport, not to me. It becomes the key, the spark to kindle divine fire. Her life, her defiant spirit, her futile struggles: all will be unraveled, spilled upon the blood-crusted altar. In her unmaking, Ur-Kthos rises within us, our frenzied joy magnified a thousandfold, a communion with the god's own terrible might.

The High Priestess, her eyes agleam with visions not of this world, her body painted with writhing, eldritch patterns, raises the obsidian blade. Its volcanic edge gleams, thirsting for the offering. My breath catches, poised on the edge of eternity. With a swift, sure stroke, she carves a crimson smile across the girl's throat. A choked gasp, a spray of crimson; so bright, so vital! The offering's essence arcs through the air, spattering the ancient stone. Her eyes flare with uncomprehending horror as her lifeblood pours forth in scarlet torrents. Her screams, fading to a wet gurgle, form the chorus of our hymn of devotion. The hot, coppery scent of blood weaves with lotus and sweat, an intoxicating draught that sets every nerve ablaze.

In this moment of ecstatic release, as her soul is torn from its frail husk, we become one with the Primal God. The veil parts, and for a fleeting, terrible instant, we glimpse the secrets coiled at the universe's black heart: mysteries written in the patterns of her spilled life.

I press into the throng, my voice a feral chant, eager for the true consummation. The High Priestess, her words no longer her own, dips a golden chalice into the pooling blood and raises it high. One by one, the Favored drink, tasting the raw, salty fire of the sacrifice, feeling its primal force surge through their veins. The blood strikes like lightning, shattering all restraint. The drums roar louder, urging us onward. Silks are rent asunder, bodies slick with sweat and smeared with sacred crimson collide in the flickering light. Gasps, moans, and the wet slap of flesh on flesh fill the air as Ur-Kthos's children couple in savage abandon, a writhing mass upon the temple floor. This becomes our ultimate offering: our pleasure, our life, amplified by blood, given to the Great Serpent in a torrent of primal worship. This is the soul-searing ecstasy of union with our god.

I surrender to the tide, the drums a pulse in my blood. My robes are torn away, the sigils on my skin glowing like witch-fire. I move among the faithful, my hands finding flesh, my lips tasting salt and heat. A woman presses against me, her nails raking my back as she howls the god's name. Another grips my shoulders, her breath a furnace against my neck as we move as one. The blood-smeared altar looms, its power a living thing. I become both hunter and prey, weaving the faithful into a single, ecstatic whole, our surrender tearing the veil between mortal and divine.

My fingers trace the curves of this woman's sweat-slicked body as the chant reaches a fevered crescendo. Her breasts swell, lush and unblemished, as I press her against the altar's edge. My lips burn a trail down her neck, tasting her salt and fire. She arches beneath me, offering herself to Ur-Kthos's hunger. My hand slides between her thighs, finding her wet and eager, her folds parting like a blooming flower. I plunge two fingers into her depths, relishing her tight, pulsing heat. She writhes upon me, her cries of passion lost to the throbbing incantation that reverberates through the chamber. With skilled caress, I tease the sensitive bud at her center until she breaks asunder, her essence flowing like a river over my probing fingers. I replace digit with manhood, my rigid shaft parts her trembling folds to claim her pulsating depths. Her legs lock around me, pulling me deep as I thrust, her walls gripping me like a velvet vice. The altar pulses beneath us, feeding on our ecstasy. She claws my shoulders, her second climax tearing a cry from her throat as I kiss her fiercely, biting her lip until I taste copper. I withdraw and her swollen lips tremble in the wake of her release.

Now, with each stroke, Ur-Kthos awakens within me: a vast, serpentine will coiling through my soul. My voice roars in a tongue older than time, the chant a primal force. Ecstasy crashes over me, my climax a torrent of thick, creamy jets that arc and splatter upon the sacred stone. My body shudders, spent, as I collapse among the faithful, our sweat-slicked forms entwined. Our cries rise as one, a hymn of exultation.

The shadows on the walls writhe, the hieroglyphs pulsing with unnatural life, as if Ur-Kthos himself gazes upon us: sated yet ravenous. I am no longer myself, merely a fragment of the god, my pleasure, my pain, my existence a perfect offering to his dread will. Ur-Kthos demands, and we, his faithful, give with savage joy, our faces upturned to catch the sacred droplets of his blessing, our bodies instruments of his divine hunger.

The End.
