# The Shadow of Xuthal Keep

**Synopsis**

Lord Hadrian Velius, heir to a dying bloodline cursed by the agonizing "Velian Wasting," commands the crumbling Karthan Keep, an Aquilonian fortress teetering on the edge of a vast desert. Beneath the keep's ancient stones lie the cyclopean ruins of a Xuthalite outpost, where Xarthas, an undying Stygian lich of unfathomable age, has anchored his malevolent power for centuries. As the curse accelerates, manifesting in tormenting visions and grotesque physical decay, Hadrian is driven to desperate and soul-staining choices in his struggle for survival. Besieged by mysterious mercenaries and haunted by the psychic weight of the ruins below, he must delve into forbidden Stygian arts and alien Xuthalite lore, making dark bargains with djinn and committing unspeakable acts to gain the knowledge needed to confront the ancient sorcerer. This is H.P. Lovecraft's classic tale "The Alchemist" reimagined within Robert E. Howard's brutal, sorcery-drenched Hyborian Age, where one man's battle against an eternal shadow threatens to consume not only his body and mind, but his very humanity.

## Chapter 1: The Lair of Ages

The air in the cyclopean chamber hung thick and poisonous; it was a charnel miasma woven from millennia of accumulated dust, the cloying sweetness of forgotten embalming spices, and the dry, metallic reek of shed blood so ancient it had seeped into the black basaltic stone itself, becoming one with the very bones of the earth. It tasted of secrets that should have remained entombed, of time stretched thin and brittle as a mummy's cerements. Here, in lightless depths beneath the sun-blasted wastes of Stygia, in vaults forgotten even by the serpent-priests of accursed Khemi, Xarthas stirred from his deathless vigil.

A figure moved through the gloom with a slow, deliberate shuffle that barely disturbed the settled detritus of ages, each footfall raising tiny plumes of dust that hung suspended in the dead air. The only illumination bled from hairline fissures in the massive, non-Euclidean masonry overhead: remnants of some elder race that had carved these depths before man first raised temples to gods now dust. Ghostly shafts of light impaled the darkness, catching on motes that danced their slow, eternal dance in the stagnant air. A second source of light pulsed with sickly luminescence: crystalline tubes and tarnished brass orbs arrayed upon a massive obsidian slab, their unholy radiance casting writhing shadows across rune-carved walls. Strange fluids, thick as ichor and dark as the blood of serpents, gurgled through the tubes with obscene vitality, their shifting movements throwing grotesque silhouettes that writhed like tormented djinn upon walls etched with runes of power, runes that spoke of pacts with beings from the Outer Dark.

The shuffling figure, draped in robes the color of dried viscera or of old blood gone to rust, paused before the obsidian slab. A hand emerged from those tattered sleeves: skeletal, wrapped in papyrus-dry skin the hue of ancient parchment yellowed by centuries. Long fingernails, blackened and hooked like the talons of some carrion-feeding vulture of the damned, moved with obscene delicacy to adjust a complex series of lenses and mirrors. The apparatus redirected a beam of corpse-light onto a small jade box resting at the center of the slab, its surface crawling with intricate carvings that seemed to shift and writhe in the unclean illumination. The box, no larger than a man's fist-clenched heart, pulsed with a faint internal rhythm; it was a captured heartbeat stolen from the living, throbbing with obscene life in the oppressive silence of the tomb.

Xarthas leaned closer, and a sound escaped that withered throat. It was dry and rasping, like the rustle of grave-dust stirred by tomb-winds, or perhaps the distant echo of laughter from something that had forgotten what mirth meant. With one talon-tipped finger, it traced a sigil upon the jade surface, a symbol of such potent and forbidden Stygian sorcery that it predated the sepulchers of the Giant-Kings, predated the first priest who had bowed his head before Father Set's crimson altars. For a moment, the light within the box flared, and a faint, ethereal whisper, like a thousand dying breaths, echoed through the laboratory, the faint, collective sigh of souls ensnared.

Satisfied, the sorcerer straightened, its movements stiff, joints cracking like dry twigs. It turned from the slab, its cowled head sweeping across the chamber, surveying shelves laden with scrolls bound in human skin, jars containing things best left undescribed (organs that still twitched, eyes that still watched) and arcane instruments of torture and forgotten Xuthalite science, plundered from the ruins of that accursed city when it still dreamed its black dreams. This was a place of power, of knowledge wrested from the unwilling, of life unnaturally, hideously prolonged.

As Xarthas passed a polished shield of dark, volcanic glass hanging upon one wall, a relic from some forgotten, pre-human city whose name was a blasphemy, its reflection was momentarily caught. The cowl had slipped slightly. Beneath it, a face was visible: skin stretched taut over a lipless skull, eye sockets burning with pinpricks of malevolent, ancient intelligence. Where flesh remained, it was desiccated, leathery, clinging to bone with grim tenacity. This was no mere ancient. This was Xarthas, the Soul-Sealed, a being who had bartered his humanity for an eternity of undeath, his soul anchored not within this decaying shell, but within that pulsating jade box, his phylactery, the source of his undying horror. He was a lich, a sorcerer king who had cheated Set's final judgment countless times, and the very stones of this deep-hidden lair thrummed with his enduring, patient evil. His thoughts, cold as the void between stars, turned north, towards Aquilonia, towards a certain crumbling keep, and a bloodline that had long been a minor, yet persistent, irritation.

## Chapter 2: The Shadow of Karthan Keep

The wind came howling out of the south like the death-rattle of the desert itself. It was a dust-laden breath that clawed at the crumbling battlements of Karthan Keep with invisible talons. It carried the grit of endless wastes and the faint, unsettling reek of something ancient and diseased, a miasma that clung to the decaying Aquilonian fortress like a funeral shroud. Here, on the ragged edge of civilization, where the writ of King Numedides was worth less than a beggar's spit, hope was a currency long since debased and spent.

Lord Hadrian Velius, master of this gods-forsaken outpost, stood upon the highest watchtower like a sentinel carved from weathered stone. His knuckles were bone-white on the wire-wound hilt of his broadsword, his gaze fixed on the shimmering heat-devils that danced their mocking jig above the endless dunes. He was in his late twenties, an age when Aquilonian nobles should be drowning themselves in wine and women and the serpentine intrigues of court. Yet lines of premature age were carved deep around his eyes and mouth. His skin had taken on a subtle, unnatural pallor: the color of old parchment, of things long buried. The "Velian Wasting," the hereditary doom of his line (whispered by the few remaining locals to be the "Breath of Xuthal" or the "Dreamer's Kiss") whispered its insidious promises in the marrow of his bones, in the increasingly vivid, violating dreams that stole his sleep, and in the faint, but undeniable, tremor that had begun to afflict his sword hand.

Karthan Keep itself was a monument to futility; it was a scab of weathered stone upon the festering wound of the borderlands. Its garrison was a pathetic handful: ill-supplied, despair-riddled wretches whose morale hung by a thread that could snap at any moment. The isolation gnawed at them. The threat of desert raiders was a constant knife against the throat. But worst of all were the whispers; the mad, sanity-shredding whispers that seemed to seep up through the very foundations of the keep like poisonous vapors from some unseen abyss. For beneath its worn stones, dangerously close, lay the cyclopean ruins of an ancient Xuthalite outpost, a place of palpable psychic suffering and forgotten horrors, a cancer in the earth. The locals, those few who dared speak its name, called this place "Xuthal Keep," or "the Keep under the Shadow of Xuthal," their voices hushed with a primal fear. The shadow was literal, an oppressive gloom that seemed to stain the very air, and metaphorical, a corrupting influence, an inescapable curse that had clung to the Velius name for generations.

Hadrian drew his threadbare cloak tighter, though the desert air offered little chill. He was a seasoned warrior, hardened by brutal skirmishes with Picts in the western forests and now by the grim realities of commanding a doomed outpost against foes both human and other. Cynicism was his armor, pragmatism his shield. Yet, even he could not entirely ignore the agonizing sensitivity that had bloomed within him. He felt a raw awareness of the ancient, malevolent consciousness that pulsed from the ruins below. It was a constant, gnawing reminder of his encroaching, horrific end, a fate that had claimed every Velius lord before him, their bodies twisting, their minds shattering long before their bodies finally succumbed around their early thirties; it was a cruel consistency that spoke of deliberate, malevolent design.

A shout from below, thin and reedy, broke his grim reverie. "My lord! Riders sighted! Dust devils on the southern horizon, too many for a merchant train!"

Hadrian’s jaw tightened. Another patrol late. Or worse. In Karthan Keep, "worse" was the only certainty. He descended the winding stone steps, the tremor in his hand a little more pronounced today.

## Chapter 3: The Captain and the Coming Storm

In the cramped, torch-lit bailey, what passed for the garrison of Karthan Keep was assembling. A motley collection of hard-bitten border ruffians, disgraced knights, and men who had nowhere else to run, their armor dented, their weapons notched. Among them was young Perrin, barely old enough to sprout a beard, his eyes still holding a naive spark of hope, a belief in heroic deeds that grated on Hadrian’s cynicism. There was also Ser Borin, a knight whose title was stained by past cowardice in a border war, his resentment towards the Velius name a poorly veiled secret; he served now only because no other lord would have him.

At their head stood Ser Rook, captain of the guard. He was a granite-hewn man whose face was a roadmap of old scars, each one a tale of blood and iron. His eyes held the weary resignation of one who had looked into Death's face so often they were on intimate terms. His grizzled beard was shot through with grey, but those massive shoulders were still broad as a bullock's yoke, and his grip on his dented longsword was still firm enough to split skulls. Rook had served Hadrian’s father, and it was whispered he stayed not just for duty, but for a debt unpaid: a failure to prevent the old lord’s swift decline when the Wasting had taken hold with unusual ferocity. The survival of Karthan Keep, however bleak, was perhaps Rook's last, desperate penance.

"Report, Rook," Hadrian said, his voice rougher than he intended.

"Scouts report a large band, milord. Zingarans by their look, or corsairs venturing far inland. Armed to the teeth. They move with purpose, not like simple raiders." Rook spat onto the dusty ground. "Smells like trouble brewed in a Stygian pot, if you ask me."

Hadrian nodded grimly. Zingarans this far east often meant they were in the pay of someone with deeper pockets and darker intentions. "How many?"

"Too many for us to meet in an open field, milord. Fifty, perhaps more. And they look like they mean to stay awhile."

A knot tightened in Hadrian’s stomach. Fifty. His own effective fighting force numbered less than twenty, and half of those were more adept at finding the bottom of a wine skin than holding a shield wall.

"The walls are crumbling, Rook," Hadrian said, his voice low. "The south gate is barely holding. If they bring siege engines…"

Rook’s gaze met his. "Then we die hard, milord. As Velius men always have." There was no bravado in his tone, only a grim statement of fact. He had served Hadrian’s father, and his father before him. He knew the doom that hung over this place, over this bloodline. Later, over a meager meal of dried meat and stale bread, Rook spoke, his voice low. "I swore to your father I’d see his line endure, milord. But I faltered once, in the western woods, when Picts came howling. He took a spear that was meant for me. The wound festered, and the Wasting. It took him faster after that. I’ll not falter again, even if this cursed place takes us all."

"See to the defenses," Hadrian ordered, the weight of Rook’s confession adding to his own burdens. "Water, arrows, what little oil we have. Every man to his post. And Rook…"

"Milord?"

"If the worst comes, ensure none of them are taken alive. You know what these desert dogs do to captives."

Rook’s eyes, for a moment, flickered with something akin to pain, but he merely inclined his head. "It will be done, milord."

As Rook barked orders, a wave of dizziness washed over Hadrian. The air seemed to thicken, the familiar psychic pressure from below intensifying, coiling around his thoughts like a serpent. Grotesque images, fleeting and nightmarish, flickered at the edges of his vision: things with too many limbs, faces that were not faces. He clenched his fists, fighting it back. Not now. By all the gods of Aquilonia, not now.

The days that followed were a blur of frantic preparations and gnawing tension. The Zingarans, or whoever they were, established a rough camp just out of bow shot. Their intentions were as opaque as a desert night, their patience unnatural, as if directed by a will that knew nothing of mortal haste. One of Hadrian’s scouts, before dying of a poisoned dart, had gasped out a broken phrase overheard from their campfires; he spoke of a "Shadow-Priest of the Jade Box" and "riches beyond mortal dreams," and a Stygian amulet clutched in the dead scout’s hand confirmed their dark allegiance. They made no immediate assault, content to let the heat and the keep’s own decay do their work. Supplies dwindled. Water became more precious than gold. The whispers in the lower chambers of the keep grew louder, more insistent. Young Perrin began to speak of glorious charges and divine intervention, his naivety a stark contrast to the growing despair. Ser Borin, meanwhile, was seen hoarding rations, his muttering about the "Velius curse dragging them all to hell" growing louder. One night, three men, their faces masks of terror, attempted to desert, only to be caught by Rook and brought before Hadrian. Their pleas for mercy were cut short by the pragmatic justice of the borderlands; their fate served as a grim warning, but did little to quell the rising tide of hopelessness.

## Chapter 4: The Wells of Despair

The Zingarans were patient. Too patient. They were not merely besieging the keep; they were waiting. For what, Hadrian could only guess, but the dread in his gut told him it was tied to the growing unease beneath his feet, to the curse that gnawed at his own flesh and mind. The desert tribes, usually a scattered nuisance, had also grown bolder, their raiding parties striking with unnerving frequency at any who dared venture beyond the keep’s crumbling walls. They were desperate, their usual watering holes drying up under the relentless sun, or so it was said.

One sweltering afternoon, as Hadrian surveyed the enemy camp through heat-shimmer that made the distant tents ripple like mirages, a grim idea took root in his mind. It was born of desperation and the cold pragmatism that had become his sole remaining companion. There was one major oasis: the Serpent's Tooth, a day's hard ride from the keep. It was the lifeblood of the local tribes, and likely the besiegers too would turn to it when their own supplies ran dry.

He summoned Rook. "The Serpent’s Tooth," Hadrian said, his voice flat. "We know the tribes rely on it. If that well were to become unusable…"

Rook's eyes widened, his weathered face going pale beneath its sun-darkened bronze. "Milord, that water is life itself to them. To poison it..." He swallowed hard. "That is a deed even Stygian devils might balk at. You speak of condemning women, children, old grandfathers, innocents who never raised a blade against us. Have we fallen so far into the abyss?" His scarred hand gestured toward the parched wasteland. "I have crossed swords with these desert folk, aye, and spilled their blood. But I have also shared water with them under truce banners. There are codes, milord. Even in this gods-forsaken land, there are codes."

"And what of our women and children, Rook, if we had any left to protect?" Hadrian's voice came out harsh as the desert wind. "What of young Perrin, who still dreams his fool's dreams of glory while his belly gnaws itself raw with hunger? What of our men, dying of thirst or choking on their own blood at the hands of these jackals who serve a Shadow-Priest of Stygia? This is not some tourney field where knights play at war. This is survival, red in tooth and claw. The tribes press us from one side, the Zingarans squeeze from the other. We are caught in a vice, and I'll be damned to Set's seventh hell before I let it crush us."

The old captain looked away, his face etched with a conflict that mirrored Hadrian's own, though Hadrian's was buried deeper, under layers of encroaching despair. "There is a certain herb," Rook said slowly, reluctantly, his voice heavy with distaste. "Moonpetal. Odorless, tasteless in water. But it brings a swift and agonizing death. The desert folk know it well. They call it the 'Silent Scream'." He paused. "If it must be done, milord, then at least spare the smaller spring at the Twin Rocks. It is little used by warriors, more by the old ones and the women who gather herbs. A small mercy, perhaps, in a sea of damnation."

Hadrian felt a chill despite the desert heat. Rook’s attempt at mitigating the horror only underscored its magnitude. "A small mercy it is, then," he conceded, the words like stones in his mouth. "But the Serpent’s Tooth; it must be done. This burden is mine. I will lead the party. You are needed here, to hold the keep." He saw the protest in Rook’s eyes, the deep disappointment, but his gaze was implacable. This was a stain he would bear alone, or so he told himself.

Under the cloak of a moonless night, Hadrian and five of his most desperate, hardened men, their faces grim, slipped out of a sally port. They carried waterskins filled not with life-giving water, but with a concentrated infusion of Moonpetal, enough to turn an oasis into a graveyard.

The ride was tense, every shadow a lurking enemy. The desert itself seemed to watch them, its silence accusatory. When they reached the Serpent’s Tooth, a small, palm-fringed pool shimmering under the starlight, it was deserted. The act itself was sickeningly simple. They poured the poisoned water into the well, watching it dissipate into the clear depths. Hadrian felt a part of his soul shrivel and die with each emptied skin. He had condemned hundreds, perhaps thousands, to a horrifying death without ever drawing his sword against them.

They returned to Karthan Keep as the first grey light of false dawn stained the eastern sky like a bruise. Their faces were masks of exhaustion and something darker: something that no amount of wine or prayer would ever wash clean. The immediate effect was not long in coming. Within three days, scouts brought back reports that turned even hardened men pale. The tribal encampments had become charnel houses: bodies contorted in final agonies, faces frozen in silent screams, the very sand stained dark with the blood that had poured from their noses and mouths as the poison did its work. The tribal pressure on the keep vanished as they were consumed by this new, invisible terror. The Zingarans, too, seemed unsettled, their patrols more wary, though they did not break their siege. Young Perrin, upon hearing the news, looked at Hadrian with a new, horrified understanding, his naive hope visibly crumbling.

Hadrian had bought his keep a reprieve, but the price was etched onto his conscience in acid. Rook looked at him with eyes that held a new, sorrowful understanding; they shared a burden of damnation. The whispers from below the keep seemed to mock him, louder now and tinged with a sibilant approval.

## Chapter 5: The Wasting and the False Hope

The act of poisoning the wells, while achieving its brutal objective, seemed to feed the Velian Wasting like blood fed a leech. The curse accelerated, gorged on his atrocity. The nightmares that had once been confined to sleep now invaded his waking hours, bleeding into reality until he could no longer tell where one ended and the other began. He saw the faces of the dead tribesmen in the shifting patterns of windblown sand, their eyes accusing, their mouths open in silent condemnation. He heard their death-rattles in every sigh of the wind, felt their cold fingers brush against his neck in the dead of night. His flesh grew looser on his bones, his skin taking on a more pronounced, deathly pallor. The tremor in his hand was now a constant companion, making even the simple act of lifting a goblet a trial. His men watched him with a mixture of fear and pity.

One sweltering evening, as despair threatened to drag him down into madness's waiting maw, a figure appeared at the main gate of Karthan Keep, materialized from the desert dusk itself like some djinn from an ancient tale. He was gaunt to the point of emaciation, his skin burned black as old leather by the merciless sun. He called himself Myrddin, and his eyes burned with an unnerving intensity from beneath a ragged, dust-caked hood: the eyes of a zealot or a madman, or something worse. He carried no weapon, only a worn leather satchel, and his knowledge of the keep, and of the Velius line, was unsettlingly precise for a mere wanderer. As he passed into the torchlight, Hadrian caught a glimpse of an intricate, serpent-coil tattoo disappearing beneath the man's frayed sleeve: a design disturbingly similar to Stygian hieroglyphs he’d seen in ancient texts. Myrddin’s eyes, for a fleeting instant, seemed to hold an unnatural, golden glint, like those of a desert viper sizing up its prey. Rook, ever cautious, had wanted to turn him away, but Hadrian, clutching at any straw, ordered him admitted.

Brought before Hadrian, Myrddin examined the lord with eyes that seemed to pierce flesh and bone. "The shadow of Xuthal is heavy upon you, Lord Velius," he rasped, his voice like dry leaves skittering across stone. "An old sickness. A dark sickness. The desert remembers its own debts, and demands payment in kind. Some hearts believe themselves hidden, but all are known to the dust."

"Can you do anything?" Hadrian asked, the words tasting of ash. He expected nothing.

Myrddin produced a small clay pot from his satchel. Inside was a pungent, dark green paste. "This is Sun-Root, mixed with the tears of the Nightbloom, gathered under a blood moon when the desert holds its breath and the dead walk." His voice was like sand scraping over stone. "It will not cure what has been woven into the very soul of this cursed land, what runs in your blood like poison. Some shadows are eternal, Lord Velius. They cannot be dispelled, only... delayed. But this may grant you a sunlit hour in your encroaching night. Clarity, for a time. A sword-arm that does not shake. Eyes that see true."

Desperate, drowning in despair, Hadrian allowed the herbalist to apply the poultice. The paste burned like liquid fire against his skin, and he gritted his teeth against a scream. But within hours (by all the gods, within hours) the tremors that had plagued him lessened to faint echoes. The horrifying visions that had been as real as the stones beneath his feet receded, fading back into the realm of nightmare where they belonged. A measure of strength flowed back into his limbs like wine into an empty cup. It was no cure, he knew. The cold dread still coiled in his belly. But it was a reprieve, a brief clearing in the storm. For the first time in months, Hadrian felt a sliver of something other than utter despair. He could think, he could plan. He could fight.

He rewarded Myrddin with what little coin the keep possessed and offered him sanctuary. The herbalist accepted with a thin, enigmatic smile that did not reach his burning eyes. "I will stay until the next shifting of the sands, lord," he said, his gaze lingering on Shadowbane, which hung above the hearth. "Or until the shadow reclaims its due. The old powers always do. Be wary of victories that taste too sweet. Some are merely the bait in a larger trap." For a few precious weeks, Hadrian clung to this fragile respite, focusing his energies on the dwindling hope of breaking the siege, of somehow surviving. Myrddin lingered, a silent, watchful presence, occasionally offering cryptic pronouncements that seemed to hint at deeper, more terrible truths about the nature of Xarthas and the forces at play. The Zingarans remained, their patience a silent, unnerving threat.

But Xuthal's shadow was not so easily cheated. The ancient darkness would not be denied its due. The reprieve was, as Myrddin had cryptically implied, temporary: a cruel jest, nothing more. One morning, Hadrian awoke to find the tremors had returned with savage vengeance, worse than before, as if the curse were punishing him for his brief escape. His body was wracked with fever that burned like the desert sun concentrated through glass. The visions swarmed back like carrion flies to rotting meat, more potent, more violating, more real than ever. The Sun-Root paste, when applied, now offered no relief, only a sickening, sweet scent that seemed to mock his suffering.

He summoned Myrddin, but the herbalist was gone. He vanished as mysteriously as he had arrived. His small chamber was empty, save for a single, withered Nightbloom petal on the dusty floor (a petal that, on closer inspection, seemed to have the faint, iridescent sheen of a serpent's scale) and the lingering scent of desert herbs and something else... something ancient and faintly reptilian. Rook reported no one had seen him leave. It was as if the desert itself had reclaimed him. Myrddin had been a fleeting mirage, a cruel trick of hope in a hopeless land, or perhaps something far more sinister. His final, unheard departure felt like a judgment.

The false hope, so briefly cherished, was extinguished, leaving behind an even deeper, more bitter despair. The Wasting was not just a physical decay. It was a sentient, malevolent force, toying with him. And Hadrian knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the soul, that its source lay beneath his feet, in the accursed ruins of the Xuthalite outpost, where an even older, more patient evil dreamed its dark dreams.

## Chapter 6: Whispers of the Soul-Sealed

Driven by the resurgence of his curse and the suffocating presence of the Zingarans, Hadrian plunged into the dusty, neglected archives of Karthan Keep. Generations of Velius lords had accumulated scrolls and tablets, many crumbling to dust, detailing local legends, border skirmishes, and, most disturbingly, fragmented accounts of their family’s blighted history.

Most were rambling, filled with the superstitions of unlettered men. But then he found it: a slim volume bound in cracked, human-like hide, its pages brittle. It was penned by his great-grandfather, Lord Valerius Velius, a man reputed to have been a scholar before the Wasting claimed his mind.

Valerius wrote of an entity he called "Xarthas," the "Soul-Sealed," an ancient Stygian sorcerer of immense power who, centuries ago, had made his lair in the Xuthalite ruins beneath where Karthan Keep would eventually be built. The sorcerer, Valerius claimed, had achieved a form of horrific immortality, not true life, but an undying state anchored to a powerful artifact, a "soul-jar," hidden deep within the ruins. The Velius Wasting, the journal theorized, was no mere curse of place, but a deliberate affliction, a psychic poison exuded by Xarthas, or perhaps a tool to weaken the Velius line, whose ancestral lands sat atop his sanctum.

The journal spoke of Thalis, the Stygian sorceress who had met her end in Xuthal at the hands of a certain Cimmerian. Valerius believed Thalis was a distant descendant of Xarthas, perhaps even unaware of her ancestor’s continued existence, a lesser sorceress dabbling in powers her forebear had mastered and transcended. Xarthas, the journal chillingly suggested, was an evil far older, far more patient than the fleeting horrors of Xuthal’s dreaming city.

Most terrifying were the accounts of previous Velius lords who had descended into the ruins, seeking to end the curse. Some never returned. Others came back transformed. One ancestor, Lord Marius, claimed to have slain Xarthas in a sorcerous duel, even describing the destruction of a "serpent-marked urn" he believed to be the soul-jar. Yet, Marius himself succumbed to the Wasting a year later, his final days filled with screams that Xarthas was "rebuilding himself from the dust and shadows."

The implication was clear: Xarthas had returned from "death" before. Any victory against him was an illusion. The Zingarans outside, Hadrian now suspected, were not mere mercenaries. They were Xarthas’s pawns, perhaps summoned to ensure no interference while the sorcerer completed some new stage of his dark machinations, or while he dealt with the current, troublesome Lord of Karthan Keep.

The knowledge was a cold weight in Hadrian's soul. He was not just fighting a siege or a family curse. He was facing an immortal evil, a lich-king of Stygian shadow. Hope, already a dying ember, threatened to be extinguished entirely.

## Chapter 7: The Djinn’s Bargain

The days bled into a grim routine of dwindling supplies and mounting despair. While Hadrian wrestled with the terrible knowledge gleaned from his ancestor’s journal, the Zingarans tested the keep’s crumbling defenses. One sun-baked afternoon, a section of the western wall, long neglected, began to give way under a concerted push from a score of their brutish warriors, led by a hulking champion whose scarred face was a mask of savage glee. Ser Rook (old wounds screaming with every movement) bellowed a challenge that would have done a Cimmerian proud and hurled himself at the breach. Dust and blood choked the air as the few able-bodied defenders rushed to his side with desperate valor. Rook's greatsword became a silver blur of death, his movements those of a cornered lion who knows no retreat, his age burned away in the white-hot fury of battle. He parried a crushing blow from the Zingaran champion’s axe, the impact jarring his bones, then, with a guttural roar, lunged, his blade finding a gap in the brute’s crude armor. The champion fell with a choked cry, and the Zingarans, their leader slain, faltered. Rook and his men, though outnumbered, drove them back from the breach, their desperate valor buying Karthan Keep a few more precious, blood-soaked days. Rook himself leaned heavily on his sword afterwards, a fresh gash bleeding freely on his arm, his breath coming in ragged gasps. His valor was undeniable, but the fight had taken its toll, a stark reminder of their dwindling strength.

It was in the oppressive quiet that followed this brief, savage clash that Hadrian’s resolve hardened. Conventional methods were futile. The keep was dying. He was dying. If he was to face Xarthas, if he was to have even a sliver of a chance to break this cycle of doom, he needed more than swords and courage. He needed forbidden knowledge, a path into the sorcerer’s lair, an edge against an enemy who had cheated death for centuries.

His mind turned to the whispers of the desert: to the ancient, elemental horrors that were said to haunt the deep wastes where no sane man ventured. Beings older than Stygia itself, older than mankind's gods, older perhaps than the stars that wheeled overhead in their cold and uncaring dance. Djinn.

He remembered Rook speaking of one such legend in hushed, fearful tones: a djinn bound to a desolate stretch of salt flats and obsidian crags known as the Screaming Chasm. A place so accursed that even the most desperate nomads, men who would cut their own mothers' throats for a waterskin, gave it a wide berth. It was said that this djinn hoarded secrets as a dragon hoarded gold, but its price for sharing them was not mere coin or blood: it was something far worse.

Having already stained his soul with the poisoning of the wells, Hadrian found the threshold for further moral compromise had lowered. He would bargain with devils if it meant a chance, however slim.

He confided in Ser Rook, not the full extent of his suspicions about Xarthas, but his need to seek out this djinn. The old captain’s face grew pale. "Milord, such beings are not to be trifled with. Their bargains are poison, their promises twisted."

"And what choice do I have, Rook?" Hadrian's voice was raw. "To sit here and rot, while that... thing below us grows stronger?"

Reluctantly, Rook agreed to hold the keep. He knew a desperate man when he saw one, and Hadrian Velius was a man walking into the abyss with his eyes open. "There is one thing, milord," Rook said, his voice heavy. "The djinn is said to demand a sacrifice of... fresh life. A soul untainted by the Wasting, to 'sweeten the air of its prison'."

Hadrian’s blood ran cold. He had few men left whose loyalty was absolute, whose souls were not already scarred by the horrors of Karthan Keep. His gaze fell upon young Lycus, barely old enough to grow a proper beard, earnest as a hound pup, brave as a lion cub. Only the week before, the boy had shyly confessed his dreams: to see the great plazas of Tarantia with his own eyes, to earn enough coin to buy a small farm far from these blighted borders where his younger sister might grow up safe from the horrors that haunted men's sleep. The boy still looked at Hadrian with the hero-worship of youth that had not yet learned that heroes were just men who hid their cowardice better than most. A fresh wave of self-loathing crashed over Hadrian like black water, but he pushed it down into the darkest recesses of his soul. The needs of the many, he told himself, though the "many" were dwindling fast, and Lycus's innocent dreams were a sharp pain in his corrupted heart.

He devised a plan, a cruel deception. He would announce a dangerous scouting mission into the Zingarans' territory, a mission from which few could expect to return. Lycus, eager to prove himself, to earn his lord’s favor and perhaps a path away from this doomed keep, would surely volunteer. And he did.

The night before he set out for the Screaming Chasm, Hadrian led the "scouting party," including himself, Lycus, and two other hardened men he could trust to keep silent. He led them into a carefully chosen ambush, a narrow defile where a rockslide, seemingly accidental, crushed young Lycus. Hadrian carried the boy’s broken body back, his face a mask of feigned grief. Rook watched him, his eyes saying nothing, yet saying everything. Later, the captain confronted Hadrian in the privacy of the lord’s chamber, his voice a low growl. "Lycus was a boy, Milord. He trusted you. As I trusted your father. What are we, if we sell our own children for scraps of hope from desert demons?" Hadrian, his face like stone, could only offer the hollow justification of necessity, a justification that tasted like ash even to himself. The rift between them deepened, Rook’s loyalty now a thing of grim duty rather than heartfelt allegiance.

With the "fresh soul" (or so he hoped the djinn would perceive it) wrapped in a bloodied cloak and strapped to a spare horse, Hadrian rode towards the Screaming Chasm. The two men with him were grim-faced, their loyalty bought with promises of gold they would likely never live to spend.

The Screaming Chasm was a place ripped whole from nightmare's darkest depths. The wind howled through the black, razor-edged rocks with voices: a thousand tormented souls shrieking their eternal anguish to an uncaring sky. At its heart, in a basin of cracked salt that glittered like broken teeth, a shimmering heat haze coalesced as Hadrian approached. The distortion in the air writhed, contracted, slowly taking on a vaguely humanoid form: tall and gaunt as a hanged man, its eyes twin coals of hell-fire, its laughter the sound of sand grinding on ancient bone.

"You seek what is hidden, little mortal," the Djinn’s voice was the rustle of a thousand locust wings, the dry crackle of ancient parchment. "You reek of Xuthal’s shadow, and the blood of fools."

Hadrian, his heart hammering, laid the wrapped body of Lycus before the shimmering entity. "I offer a sacrifice. For your knowledge."

The Djinn’s fiery eyes seemed to pierce through the cloak, through Hadrian himself. "A life, yes. But what I crave more is… experience. A thread of your fate, mortal. A cherished memory. These have more savor than mere blood." Its form rippled. "Tell me about Xarthas. Tell me how to find his heart. Tell me how to kill what does not live."

The Djinn laughed again, a sound that scraped at Hadrian’s sanity. "Xarthas… the old serpent. He sleeps on a bed of stolen souls. His heart is not in his breast, but in a box of green stone, where whispers congeal. To find it, follow the suffering. Where the stones weep, where the air screams in silence, there you will find the path." It then spoke of a hidden entrance, a forgotten fissure in the deepest cellars of Karthan Keep, sealed by ancient Velius wards that only one of their blood, steeped in the Wasting, could now bypass. "As for killing him... even I cannot grant you that, mortal. But I can show you how to hurt him. His power is tied to the dream-stuff of Xuthal. Disrupt the flow, shatter the conduits, and even the Soul-Sealed will feel the sting." It gave him cryptic clues, riddles of energy patterns and focal points within the ruins.

"And your price?" Hadrian rasped, his throat dry.

"The memory of your mother's face, the day she first placed Shadowbane in your young hand, her eyes bright with pride and dark with a mother's fear for her son." The Djinn's voice was a serpent's hiss. "That pure, untainted moment when you were still innocent. Give it to me. And a thread of your future: your capacity for true joy. Strip it from your soul like meat from bone. Any victory you achieve will taste of ash and wormwood. Any love will be a hollow echo in an empty hall. A trifle, surely, for a life such as yours."

Hadrian felt a cold, visceral emptiness as the precious memory (his mother’s smile, the warmth of her hand on his, the nascent pride of a boy becoming a warrior) was ripped from him, leaving a gaping, hollow ache that no victory could ever fill. The world seemed to dim slightly, the colors around him less vibrant, the distant sounds of the keep more muffled, as if he were already becoming part of the desert's desolate silence. He knew, with chilling certainty, that the "thread of fate" was no trifle. He had bound himself to this creature of the waste, bartering his very humanity.

But he had what he came for. Knowledge. A path. A sliver of desperate, terrible hope. He returned to Karthan Keep, the Djinn’s laughter echoing in his mind, a constant, unwelcome companion.

## Chapter 8: The Ancestor’s Clue and the Descent

Armed with the Djinn’s cryptic pronouncements and the location of the hidden entrance, Hadrian felt a grim resolve solidify within him. The knowledge that Xarthas’s soul-anchor was a "box of green stone" resonated with the image of the jade box from his great-grandfather’s journal. The pieces, however horrific, were falling into place.

He revisited Valerius's journal, his eyes now seeking different details. The Djinn had spoken of disrupting Xuthalite energies. Valerius had written of his own descent, of facing Xarthas, and mentioned, almost as an aside, "...the great, pulsating heart-crystal of the outpost, which I struck with the Velius ancestral blade, causing the sorcerer to recoil as if struck himself, and the very air to shriek... and the lesser conduits shattered, his shadows weakened for a time..."

A heart-crystal. Lesser conduits. A Velius ancestral blade. Hadrian’s blood quickened. The blade, ‘Shadowbane’, was a relic of his house, a heavy, unadorned sword of dark, meteoric iron, said to have been forged in an age when gods walked the earth. It hung above the cold hearth in the keep’s great hall, largely ignored. Could this be the key, the "desperate tactic" he needed?

He took down Shadowbane from its place above the cold hearth. The blade felt cold: cold as death itself, unnaturally heavy in his grip as if forged from fallen stars. Yet it hummed faintly, a resonance that vibrated up his arm and through his Wasting-afflicted flesh, almost... soothing the tremor for a heartbeat. This was it. This was the weapon he would carry into the abyss. The weapon with which he would either slay his demon or join it in eternal damnation.

The Zingarans still maintained their siege, a constant, oppressive presence. But Hadrian’s focus was now singular: the descent. He gathered what few loyal men remained (Rook, and a handful of others who would follow him into hell itself). He told them only that he meant to confront the source of the keep’s woes, to end the curse. He did not speak of Xarthas by name, nor of the true nature of their foe. Some truths were too terrible to share.

Following the Djinn's cryptic directions and Valerius's crumbling map, they found the fissure in the deepest, oldest cellar of Karthan Keep, a section carved from the living rock in some age before the first Velius had ever set foot in this accursed land. It was sealed by a massive stone slab covered in fading Velius wards that glowed faintly in the torchlight like dying embers. As Hadrian (his hand infused with the sickly energy of the Wasting) touched the cold stone, the wards flared with angry, purple light, writhing like serpents, then sputtered and died with an almost audible scream. With a groan like the earth itself crying out in pain, the slab ground aside, revealing a dark, narrow passage that descended into oppressive, tomb-black darkness. The air that billowed out was a physical assault, reeking of age and decay and something worse: a palpable, psychic malevolence that made strong men whimper.

"Crom and Mitra protect us," Rook muttered, making an old warding sign against evil, a gesture Hadrian had not seen him make in years.

"They have no power here, old friend," Hadrian said, his voice devoid of inflection. He hefted Shadowbane. "Only this, and our own steel, have any meaning now."

He led the way, a single torch casting flickering, inadequate light. The passage twisted downwards, the silence broken only by the drip of unseen water and the rasp of their own breathing. The psychic pressure mounted with every step, the whispers becoming a cacophony of torment, clawing at their sanity. One of the men began to whimper, his eyes wide with terror. Another started muttering prayers to forgotten gods.

They emerged into a vast cavern, a Xuthalite outpost carved from the earth’s bones. Strange, non-luminescent fungi clung to the walls, providing a faint, ghostly glow. Cyclopean machinery, inert yet thrumming with a terrifying, latent power, filled the space. Pipes and conduits, like the veins of some monstrous, sleeping beast, snaked across the floor and ceiling. And in the center, suspended by shimmering webs of energy, pulsed a colossal, multifaceted crystal, easily twice the height of a man, its core a sickening, throbbing amalgam of black and violet light: the heart-crystal his ancestor had described. Smaller, obsidian-like nodes studded the walls at irregular intervals, pulsing faintly in sympathy with the great crystal.

The air was thick with the residue of centuries of suffering. This was Xarthas’s lair.

## Chapter 9: The Heart of Darkness and the Staff’s Fury

As they stepped into the vast chamber, shadows detached themselves from the deeper darkness, coalescing into monstrous forms: Stygian undead, their desiccated flesh clinging to bones animated by pure suffering, their eyes burning with cold, blue fire, and corrupted Xuthalite constructs, all angles and razor edges, moving with an unnatural, skittering gait.

"For Velius!" Rook roared, his greatsword a silver arc in the gloom, and charged the few remaining men at his back, their fear momentarily forgotten in the heat of battle.

Hadrian ignored them. His focus was on the heart-crystal, and on the figure that now emerged from the shadows near it, as if stepping from a fold in reality itself. Xarthas.

The lich was as his reflection had shown: a skeletal figure in decaying robes, eyes like burning coals in a skull. In one hand, he carried an iron rod, long and black, tipped with a pulsating orb of volatile, sickly green Xuthalite energy that seemed to suck the light from the chamber. The Staff of Retribution.

"So, the little rat has found its way into the serpent’s nest," Xarthas’s voice was a dry rustle, like bones grinding together, yet it filled the cavern, echoing with ancient power. "Your bloodline is persistent, Velius. Annoyingly so."

"This ends tonight, sorcerer!" Hadrian snarled, advancing, Shadowbane held ready. The ancestral blade felt alive in his hand, its cold hum intensifying, pushing back against the oppressive psychic weight of the lair.

Xarthas chuckled, a sound devoid of mirth. "Ends? Foolish mortal. For me, there are no endings. Only... transitions."

The battle was joined in fire and fury. While Rook and his men fought a desperate, losing battle against the sorcerer's abominations, Hadrian faced the lich himself. Xarthas was terrifyingly fast; his movements belying his desiccated, skeletal form with inhuman grace. He wielded the Staff of Retribution like a master swordsman, bolts of sickly green Xuthalite energy lashing out like striking vipers. Hadrian relied on every hard-won ounce of warrior's instinct, every lesson learned in blood, to dodge and parry the hellish onslaught. Shadowbane met the iron staff with showers of sparks, the impact jarring Hadrian to his teeth.

Hadrian fought with the fury of a doomed man, the Wasting burning in his veins, the Djinn's cryptic clues about disrupting Xuthalite energies echoing in his mind. He remembered his ancestor's journal: striking the heart-crystal.

He feinted, drawing a blast from the staff, then lunged, not at Xarthas, but towards the massive, pulsating crystal. The sorcerer’s eyes flared with something that might have been surprise, or perhaps annoyance.

"You would not dare!" Xarthas hissed, a flicker of genuine anger in his voice.

Hadrian brought Shadowbane down in a desperate, two-handed blow against the crystalline structure. The ancient blade bit deep, and a deafening, high-pitched shriek, like tortured glass, tore through the cavern. The crystal flared with a blinding, violet light, and Xarthas screamed: a thin, reedy sound, shockingly human for a moment, staggering back, clutching his head as if struck by an invisible hammer. The Xuthalite constructs faltered, their movements becoming jerky, and one of the Stygian undead collapsed into a pile of dust.

Hope, fierce and unexpected, surged through Hadrian. He had hurt it! He had found a weakness! Seizing the momentary chaos, and remembering Valerius's words about "lesser conduits," Hadrian spun, Shadowbane whistling, and shattered one of the pulsing obsidian nodes on the cavern wall. A smaller, sympathetic shriek echoed, and Xarthas flinched again, a wisp of black smoke escaping his lipless mouth. The sorcerer’s shadowy aura flickered, and for an instant, the oppressive psychic dread in the chamber lessened. Hadrian had bought himself a breath, perhaps even disrupted some minor aspect of the lich's intricate web of power.

He pressed his advantage, raining blows on the lich, Shadowbane seeming to guide his hand, its cold energy anathema to the sorcerer's unholy vitality. Xarthas fought back with renewed ferocity, his staff a whirlwind of dark power, but he was on the defensive, his movements less certain. Hadrian, fueled by adrenaline and the dawning, impossible belief that he might actually win, pushed the sorcerer back, step by agonizing step, towards the damaged heart-crystal. It was then that a hulking undead brute (its flesh hanging in tatters like a butcher's refuse, eyes burning with cold hell-fire) broke through Rook's desperate defense and lunged at Hadrian from his blind side. Before Hadrian could so much as turn, Rook threw himself into the path of the creature's bone-splintered claws with the roar of a dying lion. The talons tore through his old mail like parchment, shredding flesh and breaking ribs. "Finish it, lad!" Rook gasped, blood bubbling at his mouth and streaming down his grizzled beard as he sank to his knees, his sword clattering on cold stone. "For your father... for all of us damned souls!"

The sight of his loyal captain falling, the raw agony of that sacrifice, fueled Hadrian with a berserker rage. With a roar, he turned on Xarthas.

Then, with a snarl that was pure, distilled malice, Xarthas made his move. He saw Hadrian overextend, saw the desperate hope and now the blind fury in his eyes. With cold calculation, the lich disengaged, took a single step back, and raised the Staff of Retribution high.

"If I am to be... inconvenienced," Xarthas rasped, "then you, Velius, will burn in the fires of your hollow victory!"

And with cold, calculated malice, he brought the iron staff crashing down, not upon Hadrian, but deliberately smashing the pulsating Xuthalite orb at its tip against the unyielding stone floor with earth-shattering force.

The resulting explosion was apocalyptic. A wave of incandescent green-black energy erupted outward like the birth-scream of some elder god: a shockwave of pure, unmaking force that shattered reality itself. Hadrian's scream was lost in the cacophony as the wave tore through him. His armor vaporized like morning mist. His flesh seared and blackened. His very spirit felt as if it were being ripped apart thread by thread, unraveling into the howling void. The last thing he saw before darkness claimed him was Xarthas’s physical form dissolving in the blast, and, in the heart of the conflagration, a small, jade-green box (the soul-anchor) seeming to shatter into a million glittering fragments.

## Chapter 10: The Djinn’s Price and the Grand Deception

Pain. Agony. Oblivion. Hadrian clawed his way back from the brink, the taste of ash and his own blood thick in his mouth. The air screamed with the aftershock of the blast, the ruins of Xarthas’s sanctum smoking around him. He was a broken thing, crawling amidst the rubble, every movement an eternity of torment. The heart-crystal was a shattered, blackened husk. The bodies of Rook and his men were gone, atomized. He was dying.

But he had won. He had seen it: the jade box, Xarthas’s soul-anchor, shattered. The curse had to be ended. A grim, terrible satisfaction, a dying ember of triumph, flickered in the storm of his agony.

Then, a coldness that had nothing to do with his wounds, nothing to do with approaching death, spread through him like ice in his veins. A whisper, like sand grinding endlessly on ancient bone, slithered into the ruins of his mind. Not from the air, but from the agony itself. The Djinn. Its presence was a chilling weight, an alien pressure crushing down upon his fading spirit like a stone upon a dying insect.

"A pyrrhic victory, little mortal," the thought coiled around his shattered consciousness like a python around prey. "You have paid such a high price for a fleeting moment of theater. For a puppet show. For shadows dancing on cave walls."

"He is… gone," Hadrian tried to gasp, but no sound came. His thought was a ragged plea. "The anchor… destroyed."

The Djinn's silent laughter echoed through the ruins of his mind; it was cold and vast as the desert night, merciless as the stars wheeling overhead in their uncaring dance. "Gone? Destroyed? Oh, the grand illusions you mortals weave for yourselves, like children playing at war with wooden swords. Xarthas is patient beyond your comprehension. He anticipates. He plans centuries ahead. The box you saw shatter? A bauble. A clever decoy charged with just enough sympathetic energy to convince a dying fool of his hollow triumph."

A dread colder than death itself, colder than the void between stars, seeped into Hadrian's marrow like poison. No... by all the gods, no...

"The true anchor," the Djinn's mental voice dripped with contemptuous pity, "the little jade heart that holds his undying essence, was never here. It rests safe, shielded, in a quiet alcove far from this... messy stage. Xarthas sheds his skins as a serpent does, mortal. This body, this lair... expendable. He will rebuild. He always rebuilds."

The truth was a poisoned dagger twisting in Hadrian's shattered soul. His sacrifice, Rook's sacrifice, the poisoning of the wells, the murder of Lycus: all for nothing. A grand, cosmic jest played by an immortal sorcerer.

"You are dying," the Djinn's thought pressed in. "But your thread of fate, the one you so generously gifted me, still has a few frayed ends. I can... reweave them. Anchor you to this world. For a price, of course."

"What... price?" Hadrian's spirit whispered, clinging to that last, desperate sliver of existence.

"Your service," the Djinn replied, its mental image a shifting shadow with eyes of cold fire. "Your life, what remains of it, will be an owed debt to the sands, to the timeless, uncaring powers I represent. Your soul, already so delightfully stained, will slowly become as barren and timeless as the desert itself. You will live, Velius. But you will be... mine."

Hadrian, a broken ruin, looked at the desolation around him, felt the desolation within. He thought of Xarthas, out there, his essence secure, laughing. The alternative was oblivion. With a final, shuddering surge of will, a rictus of agony and despair twisting his unseen face, his thought was a single, choked word.

"Accepted."

A searing cold, worse than the blast, worse than any agony he had yet endured, enveloped him like a shroud. He felt something ancient and utterly alien force its way into him, violating the very core of his being, intertwining with his fading life force like parasitic roots into dying flesh. It was changing him, preserving him, but also... consuming him. Devouring his humanity one piece at a time. The vibrant hues of the dying embers around him leached away like blood from a corpse, leaving only grey ash and shadow. The distant memory of his mother's proud smile (already stolen by the Djinn) became a faded, meaningless image, an old painting whose colors had run and whose subject was forgotten. Devoid of warmth. Devoid of solace. Devoid of humanity.

## Chapter 11: The Hollow Victory and the Enduring Shadow

Through a haze of pain and the Djinn’s unholy intervention, Hadrian Velius, or what was left of him, dragged himself from the ruins of Xarthas’s lair. He was a grotesque parody of a man, his flesh a patchwork of scar tissue and weeping burns, his body twisted, his mind forever scarred by the horrors he had witnessed and the truth he now carried.

He stumbled out of the hidden passage into the cellars of Karthan Keep: a ghost returning to haunt his own tomb, a revenant clawing its way back from hell. The keep was silent as a sepulcher. The Zingarans, their master temporarily discorporated and their dark purpose severed, had vanished like smoke in the desert wind; they scattered like rats from a sinking ship. Hadrian could only surmise that the violent disruption of Xarthas's power, or the sudden severing of his immediate will, had sent the mercenaries fleeing into the wastes, their dark contract abruptly voided, their courage failing them without the sorcerer's oppressive presence to bind their greed and steel their spines.

Hadrian, fueled by the Djinn’s dark energies, barely survived. He carried with him the belief, or the desperate need to believe, that he had struck a blow, that the shattering of the decoy soul-anchor and the destruction of the lesser conduit had at least inconvenienced Xarthas, bought the world some time. He told no one of the Djinn, or of the true, horrifying nature of Xarthas’s immortality. Some burdens were too heavy to share, some truths too corrosive.

The narrative of his "victory," however, would be a grand deception, known only to him and, perhaps, to the indifferent desert gods. Xarthas’s true soul-anchor, the jade box,

remained secure, hidden in some forgotten, shielded alcove of his vast, subterranean domain. The sorcerer, his essence intact, had merely shed another temporary skin. He would begin his slow regeneration, his cold, ancient mind perhaps even subtly observing Hadrian’s "escape" with a detached, reptilian amusement.

The Velius Wasting seemed to recede from Hadrian’s ravaged frame, not cured, but suppressed by the alien energies of the Djinn that now coexisted within him. But this was no salvation. It was merely the exchange of one curse for another, perhaps even more insidious. He was bound to the Djinn, his life an "owed debt," his soul slowly, inexorably becoming as barren and timeless as the desert the creature embodied. He was a corrupted survivor, a hollow shell animated by a grim pact.

Karthan Keep remained a place of profound horror: a monument to futility and despair. Lord Hadrian Velius, its last and most accursed master, would live on as something less than a man and more than a corpse. A broken, haunted thing forever scarred by the battle, by the terrible choices that had damned his soul, by his devil's bargain with the Djinn. He would sit upon his crumbling throne (a lich in his own right, though he wore no phylactery save the alien presence coiled in his chest), gazing out at the endless, indifferent desert that stretched to the horizon. A vast, silent testament to the insignificance of mortal struggles against the crushing weight of ages. The wind would whisper through the broken stones with voices of the damned, carrying the scent of dust and despair and ancient, patient evil. And Hadrian would feel nothing but the cold, empty echo of what he had lost: his humanity, his hope, his very soul, unknowingly shadowed by the inevitable resurgence of Xarthas. A constant reminder of the ultimate futility of his sacrifice. Of the enduring, patient malevolence of the shadow that lay over Xuthal, and indeed, over all the dark corners of the world. The cycle of suffering would continue, grinding on through the ages like millstones crushing grain to powder. And the desert would reclaim its own, one grain of sand at a time, one stolen soul at a time, until the stars themselves grew cold and the last scream faded into eternal silence.

The End.
