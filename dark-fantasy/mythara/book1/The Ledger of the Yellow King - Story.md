# The Ledger of the Yellow King

*A Tale of Veilport in the Arcanum Epoch*

## I

The private booth at the back of The Silken Dagger reeked of sweat, poppy smoke, and the particular stench of desperation that clung to failed men like funeral shrouds. Corvus sat with his spine pressed flat against the velvet cushion, his leather-bound ledger open before him on the scarred oak table. His fingers—long, pale, and meticulous as a surgeon's—moved across the page with mechanical precision, tallying figures in neat columns that brooked no sentiment.

He was twenty-three years old and already looked like something carved from courthouse marble: all sharp angles and bloodless efficiency. His black hair was pulled back severe and simple, his jaw clean-shaven, his clothes the sort of fine gray wool that whispered wealth without shouting it. Everything about Corvus spoke of calculation, from the silver stylus he used instead of common quill to the way his obsidian eyes never blinked when he met another man's gaze.

Across from him, the merchant sweated.

Grevin was his name—a fat Shadowkin with skin the color of old brick and stumpy horns that curved like malformed tusks. His forehead glistened in the amber lamplight, and his hands twisted together like mating serpents as he laid out his proposal. He needed an intermediary to move contraband silks from the Dockyards to the Shadowbazaar without paying Khan Razik Goldfang's "market fees." Standard work. The price was twelve gold crowns.

"I can offer you eight," Grevin said, and his left eye twitched.

There. That involuntary spasm, small as a gnat's wing but visible to a man who'd been watching. Corvus leaned back and folded his hands across his ledger with the patience of a headsman measuring a neck.

"You're lying," he said, his voice flat and passionless as a blade drawn across whetstone. "You have the full sum. You're testing whether I'm desperate enough to accept less."

Grevin's pupils dilated. The twitch came again, betraying him like a traitor's knife. "I—that's not—"

"Your tell is the left eye. It contracts when you fabricate. You did it three times during your initial offer." Corvus closed the ledger with a sound like a coffin lid settling. "I don't do business with men who test me. Find another intermediary."

He rose to leave. Grevin's hand shot out, desperation finally cracking through his merchant's veneer like a boot through rotten ice.

"Wait! Wait, curse you—twelve crowns. The full price."

Corvus sat back down. He opened the ledger again, dipped his stylus, and made a notation. His face showed nothing—not triumph, not satisfaction, merely the cold acknowledgment that the universe had performed as expected when pressure was correctly applied.

"Six now, six on delivery," Corvus said. "Witnessed contract under the Code of Chains. If you breach, no merchant in Veilport will trade with you again. Are we agreed?"

Grevin nodded, already reaching for his purse. The gold clinked onto the table with the sound of a man selling pieces of his soul.

Later, alone in the booth after Grevin had slunk away into Shadowveil's labyrinth of vice and conspiracy, Corvus allowed himself a moment of reflection. Not pride—never that wasteful emotion—but assessment. The ledger before him represented three years of clawing his way up from the Duskway residential ward where he'd been born to parents who'd believed in fairy tales like "honest profit" and "fair dealing."

His mother and father had sold quality textiles in the Shadowbazaar, refusing to pay bribes, refusing to cut corners, refusing to understand that morality was a luxury purchased with power. The Shadowkin merchant princes had crushed them like beetles beneath a boot heel. Corvus had watched from the shadows as his parents' shop was seized, their inventory "redistributed," their names struck from the guild registries. His father had died of a wasting sickness born of poverty and despair. His mother had simply... stopped. One morning she didn't wake, and Corvus found her cold in her cot, her face peaceful for the first time in months.

He'd been sixteen.

The lesson had branded itself into his soul like a slave-mark: competence was the only currency that mattered. Sentiment was a disease of the weak. In Veilport—this cancerous jewel on the eastern coast where the Shadowkin ruled and humans were tolerated like useful rats—survival belonged to those who understood that every interaction was a transaction, every person an asset or obstacle.

Corvus had made himself into a ledger: cold, precise, and utterly unsentimental.

The question was whether it would be enough.

## II

The summons came three days later, delivered by a half-elf in Baroness livery who looked at Corvus the way one might examine a tool before purchase—clinical and measuring. The message was written on pale blue vellum in a script so elegant it seemed to mock the crude world around it:

*Your services are required for a matter of discretion. The Veiled Coin Exchange, private gallery, sunset.*

*—X.*

Corvus burned the letter immediately and spent the next two hours preparing. He bathed in cold water, scrubbing away any scent that might distract or offend. He dressed in his finest charcoal doublet with silver threading—expensive enough to suggest competence without appearing to overreach his station. He combed his hair back until not a strand defied its place, then checked his reflection in the polished steel mirror he kept in his modest Duskway apartment.

The face that stared back could have been carved from granite: severe, composed, and harder than it had any right to be at twenty-three. Good. In Veilport, youth without cruelty was blood in the water.

The Veiled Coin Exchange occupied a fortified building in the Shadowbazaar that served as the Shadow Syndicate's banking front. Its private galleries were where merchants concluded deals that couldn't survive daylight scrutiny. Corvus arrived precisely at sunset, neither early enough to seem desperate nor late enough to suggest disrespect.

The gallery was all dark mahogany and crimson velvet, lit by alchemical lamps that burned with steady golden light. In the center of the room, seated in a high-backed chair that might as well have been a throne, waited Baroness Xandrine von Mephistopheles.

She was beautiful the way winter was beautiful: all crystalline edges and fatal allure. Her skin was the pale blue-gray of glacial ice, her horns swept back from her temples in graceful curves etched with silver filigree. She wore a gown of midnight silk that clung to her form like shadow made flesh, and her eyes—those damned eyes, sulfurous yellow with slitted pupils—fixed on Corvus with the intensity of a viper selecting prey.

"The Middleman," she said, and her voice carried the faint harmonics that marked Mephistopheles blood: seduction wrapped around calculation. "They say you're the most reliable intermediary in Shadowveil. That you complete contracts with the precision of a Shadowkin and the desperation of a human. Which is it?"

"Both, Baroness." Corvus moved to the indicated chair opposite her with measured steps. He sat without fidgeting, his hands resting loose in his lap. "Precision because incompetence offends me. Desperation because humans in Veilport who aren't desperate are either fools or liars."

She smiled—a thin, approving expression that didn't reach those serpent eyes. "Honest, at least. I need something acquired from the Shadowed Athenaeum. A fragment of a Pre-Cataclysmic play called *The King in Yellow*. The curator, an elf named Naivara, has it locked in the restricted archives."

"The Athenaeum is in the Warlock's Enclave," Corvus said, his mind already calculating angles and obstacles. "Security will be substantial. And if the Shadow Syndicate discovers the theft—"

"Which is why I need an intermediary who understands discretion." Xandrine leaned forward slightly, and the lamplight caught the gems embedded in her horns, making them sparkle like captured stars. "I'm willing to pay five hundred gold crowns. Half now, half on delivery. But you should know—you're not my only candidate. A man called Garret is also bidding for this contract."

Corvus kept his face blank, but internally something cold and focused snapped into alignment. Garret. "The Glass-Eyed" Garret, they called him—a rival fixer who operated out of the Upper Undervaults using traditional blackmail and brute intimidation. He was everything Corvus despised: crude, theatrical, and effective enough to be genuine competition.

"If you're comparing bids," Corvus said carefully, "Garret will promise speed and muscle. I promise success and silence. The difference is whether you want the job done loud or done right."

"Convince me it's the latter."

He met her eyes—those hellish yellow eyes that could strip a weak man's will—and spoke with the absolute certainty of a priest reciting catechism. "Garret will go through the front door with purchased guards and a forged writ. It will work until someone checks the writ's registry seal. Then the Shadow Syndicate will know, and you'll have the Black Hands asking uncomfortable questions about why a Baroness wanted Pre-Cataclysmic theatrical fragments."

Xandrine's expression didn't change, but Corvus saw the faint tightening around her eyes. He'd struck truth.

"I," he continued, "will go through the archives at night using a researcher's credentials. No force, no noise. The curator will never know the fragment was taken until long after you've secured it elsewhere. By the time questions are asked, the trail will be stone cold."

Silence stretched between them, taut as a garrote. Finally, Xandrine reached into her gown and produced a purse heavy with coin. She set it on the table between them with a decisive thud.

"You have one week. If Garret delivers first, you get nothing. If you fail, you'll wish the Shadow Syndicate found you before I do." She stood, her gown whispering across marble like a promise of violence. "Do we have an accord?"

Corvus rose, took the purse, and nodded once. "We do."

But as he walked out of the Veiled Coin Exchange into Veilport's twilight streets, the weight of the gold felt less like payment and more like a millstone around his neck. He lacked the magical power to bypass arcane wards, the contacts to acquire a researcher's credentials, and the raw force to confront Garret if the man moved first.

He needed an edge.

He needed power that the Shadowkin couldn't take away.

He needed a pact.

## III

The Warlock's Enclave crouched in eastern Veilport like a malignant tumor given architecture: high walls of black basalt, gates of wrought iron worked into shapes that hurt to examine too closely, and above it all the crimson pennants of the Infernal Contract Guild snapping in the salt wind from the bay. Corvus had registered with the Guild three months prior—fifty gold crowns for the privilege of being officially tolerated as a "consultant in occult matters"—but registration and power were entirely different currencies.

Tonight he would balance that ledger.

He entered the Enclave through the eastern gate just after midnight, nodding to the Zariel-blood guard whose bronze skin gleamed like old armor in the torchlight. The guard barely glanced at his registry seal before waving him through. Inside, the Enclave's streets were nearly deserted save for a few warlocks in their distinctive robes—red for Fiend patrons, green for Archfey, purple for things that crawled from spaces between spaces.

Corvus wore gray, the color of the unbound.

The Shadowed Athenaeum rose before him: a three-story structure of dark stone with narrow windows that seemed to swallow light rather than emit it. Corvus had visited twice before on legitimate research, enough to know the layout and the curator's schedule. Naivara worked until the ninth bell, then retired to her apartments in the upper floors. The restricted archives occupied the basement, accessible only by a spiral stair behind a locked iron door.

He'd acquired a copy of the door key two weeks ago—a routine expenditure for a man who planned ahead.

The lock clicked open with gratifying precision. Corvus descended into darkness that pressed against his skin like cold oil, his hand trailing along the damp stone wall until he reached the archive chamber. Here, the accumulated knowledge of a hundred dead warlocks moldered in leather and vellum: grimoires bound in humanoid skin, contracts written in blood and tears, treatises on summoning that made his skull ache just to glance at their spines.

And there, on a pedestal in the archive's heart, sat a book bound in yellow silk.

Even from across the chamber, he could feel it: a presence like static electricity crawling across his thoughts, a sensation of vast attention focusing down through infinite distance. The book was wrong in ways his eyes couldn't articulate. Its angles seemed to defy geometry, its color shifted between jaundiced yellow and bile-green when he wasn't looking directly at it, and the air around it shimmered like heat rising from sun-scorched sand.

*The King in Yellow*.

Corvus approached with slow, measured steps, his heart hammering against his ribs in a rhythm his face refused to acknowledge. This was business. This was necessity. This was—

His fingers touched the silk cover.

Reality screamed.

The archive chamber folded away like burning paper, and Corvus stood suddenly in a place that couldn't exist: an endless throne room beneath a black sun that pulsed with sick light. The walls were draped in yellow silk that writhed with patterns that rewrote themselves constantly, maddening geometries that promised understanding if he would just look closer, just trace their lines into his own flesh—

"No," Corvus said aloud, and his voice echoed across impossible distances. "I'm not here to worship. I'm here to negotiate."

Laughter answered him: vast, inhuman, and threaded with harmonics that could shatter sanity like a hammer through glass. From the yellow silk emerged a figure—or perhaps it had always been there, and Corvus's mind had simply refused to acknowledge it until now. It wore a tattered yellow robe and a pallid mask with features simultaneously too perfect and too wrong to be human.

**CORVUS OF THE DUSKWAY**, the thing said without speaking, its words appearing directly in his thoughts like brands being pressed into meat. **YOU STAND IN THE COURT OF THE KING IN YELLOW, THE LORD OF LOST CARCOSA, THE FEASTER FROM AFAR. YOU TOUCHED THE BOOK. YOU CALLED, AND I HAVE ANSWERED.**

"I need power," Corvus said, and forced himself to meet those eye-holes in the pallid mask, forced himself not to think about what might be watching him through them. "I need magic that can bypass wards, influence minds, and level the field between humans and Shadowkin. I need to survive in a city that eats weakness."

**AND WHAT DO YOU OFFER IN RETURN?**

"Service. Information. Chaos, if that's what you want." Corvus's hands clenched at his sides, nails biting into palms. "I'm already damned by every measure that matters. Might as well make the damnation profitable."

The King in Yellow tilted its masked head, and Corvus heard that laughter again—soft now, almost approving. It extended one silk-wrapped hand, and in its palm sat a book: small, leather-bound, utterly mundane.

**THEN TAKE MY BOON, LITTLE MIDDLEMAN. TAKE THE BOOK OF SHADOWS AND WRITE YOUR LEDGERS IN IT. EVERY SPELL YOU CAST, EVERY SOUL YOU BEND, EVERY TRANSACTION THAT BLEEDS THE WORLD—ALL SHALL BE RECORDED. AND WHEN THE LEDGER IS FULL, WHEN YOU HAVE WRITTEN YOUR NAME IN DEEDS TOO TERRIBLE TO IGNORE, I SHALL COLLECT MY PAYMENT.**

**DO WE HAVE AN ACCORD?**

Corvus didn't hesitate. Hesitation was sentiment, and sentiment was death. He reached out and took the book.

**EXCELLENT.**

The throne room shattered. Corvus staggered backward, his hand locked around not the yellow silk tome but his own mundane trade ledger—except it wasn't mundane anymore. The leather cover was warmer than human skin, and when he opened it, the pages were no longer filled with columns of gold and silver. Instead, strange symbols covered the vellum, whispering their meanings directly into his mind:

*Guidance. Message. Thaumaturgy.*

Power. Raw, arcane, and utterly unearned. Corvus felt it settle into him like ice water in his veins, felt his consciousness expand to accommodate new senses that perceived the world as patterns of energy and influence. He could see the ward-lines now: thin golden threads of magic woven through the archives, designed to alert the curator if anyone tampered with the restricted materials.

Corvus spoke a single word—a syllable that tasted of yellow silk and madness—and the threads unraveled.

He took three pages from *The King in Yellow*, folded them carefully, and secreted them in his doublet's inner pocket. Then he rewove the ward-lines, closed his Book of Shadows, and walked out of the Shadowed Athenaeum as if the last ten minutes had been nothing more than routine research.

Behind him, written in letters of pale light visible only to his new senses, a message hung in the air:

**THE LEDGER HAS BEEN OPENED. NOW FILL IT.**

Corvus smiled for the first time in three years. It was not a pleasant expression.

## IV

The upper room of Corvus's Duskway apartment had become a war room. Maps of the Shadowbazaar and Upper Undervaults covered one wall, marked with notes in cipher that detailed Garret's known safe houses, his network of informants, and the typical routes his couriers used. On the desk sat the Book of Shadows, open to pages that described rituals for binding familiars.

Corvus had spent two days preparing. Two days observing, calculating, and transforming the raw power the King in Yellow had granted him into practical advantage. He'd learned quickly that magic was not a miraculous solution but merely another tool—powerful, yes, but requiring the same methodical application as a lock pick or a well-placed bribe.

Now came the hard part: execution.

He began the ritual just after dawn, when the light slanting through his narrow window turned the brass brazier into a basin of molten gold. The Book of Shadows had provided the incantation, and Corvus had acquired the material components: ten gold crowns' worth of charcoal, incense, and herbs that he burned with mechanical precision.

The smoke rose in coils that defied natural wind patterns, forming shapes that his warlock-touched sight recognized as invitations sent across the boundaries between worlds. He spoke the words of binding—harsh syllables that rasped his throat raw—and extended his will like a fisherman casting line into dark waters.

Something bit.

The smoke convulsed, then collapsed inward with a sound like a gasp. When it cleared, a spider sat on the edge of the brazier: as large as Corvus's palm, with a body of glossy black chitin and eyes like chips of polished jet. It regarded him with alien intelligence, and he felt the connection snap into place—a thread of consciousness linking them, allowing him to perceive what it perceived, to command without words.

"You're my inside man," Corvus told the spider, and felt satisfaction that the creature understood perfectly.

He spent the rest of the day researching the Baroness's encryption ciphers. Xandrine had provided a sample—ostensibly so Corvus could authenticate the stolen manuscript pages—but he'd recognized it immediately as a test. The cipher was based on infernal contract law, using clauses as substitution keys. Complex, but not impossible for a man who'd taught himself to read legal documents in three languages.

Corvus worked with the methodical focus of a surgeon cutting tumors, his stylus scratching across parchment as he built translation matrices and identified pattern repetitions. Before each critical deduction, he opened the Book of Shadows and whispered the cantrip for Guidance, feeling certainty bloom in his mind like a dark flower. The magical assurance didn't make him smarter—it simply ensured his competence expressed itself without the interference of doubt or fatigue.

By sunset, he'd cracked the cipher.

By midnight, he had the beginnings of a plan.

Garret would move soon—the man's style favored brute speed over careful preparation. That meant Corvus needed intelligence on his rival's operations, needed to know where Garret kept his resources and which of his people could be compromised. The spider could scout, but reconnaissance meant nothing without opportunity to exploit.

Opportunity arrived two nights later in the Shadowbazaar's night market.

## V

The new moon had turned the market into a festival of vice and commerce where anything could be bought if the price was right and the buyer knew which shadows to whisper into. Corvus moved through the crowd wearing a hooded cloak that obscured his features, his warlock-sight piercing the press of bodies to track magical auras and identify threats.

His spider familiar skittered ahead, nearly invisible against the cobblestones, feeding him impressions of the market's geography. Three blocks east, near the spice merchant stalls where saffron and cinnamon mixed with poppy smoke thick enough to taste, the spider's senses sharpened with alarm.

Corvus followed the psychic thread and found a tableau of casual brutality: three of Garret's enforcers had cornered a young pickpocket against a warehouse wall. The boy—couldn't be more than twelve—clutched a leather purse while blood ran from his nose. The lead enforcer, a scar-faced human built like an ox, raised a cudgel for another blow.

Corvus recognized the boy: Pip, one of his minor assets, a street rat he'd employed twice for courier work. Useful, but not irreplaceable. The logical choice was to walk away, to preserve his anonymity and let the boy learn the consequences of stealing from the wrong mark.

But the boy had value. And Garret's enforcers were here, exposed and confident in their numbers.

Corvus touched the Book of Shadows through his cloak, felt its warmth pulse against his palm, and made his decision. He pushed through the crowd until he stood ten paces from the scene, his hood still hiding his face. Before he acted, he whispered the Guidance cantrip—felt the terrible certainty settle over him like a mantle—then spoke the words for Charm Person.

The spell required vocal components, but the night market's chaos provided cover: a merchant three stalls over was bellowing prices, a drunk was singing an obscene ballad, and somewhere a dog fought a rat for scraps. Corvus masked his incantation in a coughing fit, his hands moving in the subtle somatic gestures that channeled power.

The magic lanced out invisible and irresistible, and Corvus felt the moment it struck the enforcer's mind: a psychic hook sinking into the soft meat of the man's consciousness. The enforcer's eyes glazed, his cudgel lowering as new thoughts— Corvus's thoughts—overwrote his aggression with sudden camaraderie.

"You," Corvus said, dropping his hood and stepping forward with the confidence of a man who knew the game was already won. "Scarface. Tell your friends this one's under my protection."

The charmed enforcer blinked, his expression shifting from confusion to something approaching warmth. "Middleman? Didn't know you had business with the kid. We thought he was freelance."

"He's mine. Tell Garret to keep his dogs on a shorter leash before they bite someone important."

The other two enforcers shifted uneasily, their hands drifting toward weapons, but Scarface waved them off. "Yeah, yeah. Our mistake. Come on, boys—plenty of other rats in this market."

They left. Corvus waited until they'd disappeared into the crowd, then grabbed Pip by his filthy collar and hauled him into the narrow alley between warehouses. The boy's eyes were wide with relief and terror in equal measure.

"Thank you, Middleman, I swear I didn't know that purse was—"

Corvus's hand cracked across the boy's face, a controlled blow that split his lip without breaking teeth. Pip reeled, then froze when he saw Corvus's expression: cold, focused, and utterly devoid of mercy.

"You owe me," Corvus said quietly. "I just spent power protecting an asset that's barely worth the copper in his pockets. You're going to repay that debt."

"Anything," Pip whispered, blood running down his chin. "Anything, I swear."

"Garret keeps a ledger of his operations in his Undervault safe house—warehouse three in the Smuggler's Highway. You're going to find a way inside, steal that ledger, and bring it to me. If you succeed, I'll pay you five gold crowns. If you fail, I'll sell you to the Shadow Syndicate as an informant and watch them feed you to the eels in the Dockyards."

Pip's face went the color of old tallow, but he nodded. Good. Fear was the most honest currency.

Corvus released him and watched the boy scramble away into the night. The charm on Scarface would last another hour, long enough for the man to return to Garret and report the encounter without suspicion. By tomorrow, Garret would know that Corvus was operating in his territory. The pressure would mount. The game would accelerate.

Perfect.

Corvus opened the Book of Shadows as he walked back toward the Duskway, and on a fresh page, he wrote in cipher: *Asset acquired. Rival engaged. Timeline accelerating. Cost: one spell slot, one child's future.*

The book seemed to pulse under his fingers, warm and approving. Somewhere beyond the spheres, the King in Yellow was watching his ledger fill, transaction by damning transaction.

## VI

The plan collapsed three days later when Pip never showed.

Corvus waited in his apartment through the appointed hour, the Book of Shadows open before him and his spider familiar perched on the windowsill watching the street below. Sunset came and went. The bells of the Iron Spire tolled the night watch. Pip didn't appear.

Which meant either the boy had fled Veilport entirely—unlikely—or Garret had intercepted him.

Corvus felt something unfamiliar stir in his chest: not quite fear, but its colder cousin—the recognition that his opponent had outmaneuvered him. He'd been so focused on his own offensive that he'd failed to anticipate Garret doing exactly what Corvus himself would have done: identify and neutralize enemy assets before they could act.

He was thinking too slowly. The OODA loop—Observe, Orient, Decide, Act—had stalled at Orient, and in a city like Veilport, hesitation was blood in the water.

Corvus closed his eyes, forced his breathing to slow, and rebuilt his mental model of the situation. Garret had Pip. Which meant Garret knew Corvus was hunting him. Which meant Garret would either accelerate his own move on the Baroness's contract or set a trap. Probably both.

His spider familiar suddenly tensed, its psychic alarm spiking. Corvus's eyes snapped open just as someone knocked three times on his door: the specific rhythm used by the Infernal Contract Guild for official business.

He concealed the Book of Shadows in a hidden compartment beneath his floorboards, checked that his dagger was loose in its sheath, and opened the door.

The half-elf courier who'd first summoned him to the Baroness stood in the hallway, her expression tight with controlled urgency. "The Baroness requires your immediate presence. There's been a complication."

Corvus grabbed his cloak without asking questions. They moved through the Duskway at a near-run, the courier setting a pace that spoke of genuine crisis. She led him not to the Veiled Coin Exchange but to a private estate in the Veilheart district—one of the Baroness's lesser properties, warded and fortified against scrying.

Inside, Xandrine paced like a caged predator, her yellow eyes blazing with fury. The moment Corvus entered, she turned on him with an intensity that made the temperature in the room seem to drop.

"Your rival has made his move," she said without preamble. "Garret didn't steal the manuscript. He kidnapped the curator, Naivara, and is forcing her to decrypt the pages for him. If he succeeds, he delivers authentic translation along with the fragments—which means he wins the contract."

Corvus's mind accelerated, variables clicking into alignment. "Where is he holding her?"

"Our informants traced him to a warehouse in the Undervaults—the Smuggler's Highway, warehouse seven. He's got six men, all armed. The curator is alive for now, but if Garret finishes the translation..." Xandrine didn't complete the sentence. She didn't need to.

"Then we move now," Corvus said. "Before he can deliver."

"*We* do nothing. You go. You retrieve both the curator and the translated fragments. If you succeed, I triple your payment. If you fail, don't bother running—there's nowhere in Veilport you can hide from what I'll do to you."

Corvus nodded once, his mind already mapping routes through the Undervaults, calculating angles of approach, weighing magic and tactics. He was thinking too slowly, and the cost was initiative. But he had one advantage Garret couldn't anticipate: Heroic Inspiration, the peculiar resilience that humans developed when survival became personal.

He touched the hidden compartment where his Book of Shadows waited and felt the King in Yellow's attention focus on him like a searchlight burning through fog.

The game had just become lethal.

## VII

The Smuggler's Highway occupied the lowest level of Veilport's Undervaults, where the ancient sewers and Pre-Cataclysmic passages intersected in a maze of damp stone and perpetual shadow. Warehouse seven crouched at the end of a cul-de-sac: a squat structure of riveted iron with a single entrance and narrow ventilation slits near the roofline.

Corvus approached alone just after midnight, his spider familiar skittering ahead to scout. Through its alien senses, he mapped the interior: six guards as promised, positioned in a loose perimeter around a central space where Garret held court. And there—bound to a chair, her elegant elven features streaked with tears—sat Curator Naivara, a manuscript spread before her.

No time for subtlety. No time for the slow approach. Garret would finish the translation within hours, and then Corvus's opportunity would evaporate like morning dew on hot stone.

He needed to move faster than thought, needed to compress the OODA loop into pure instinct. And he needed an edge.

Corvus touched the Book of Shadows and felt Heroic Inspiration flood through him—not magic exactly, but something deeper and more primal: the universe itself bending slightly to favor audacity over caution. He felt his perceptions sharpen, felt his body move with fluid certainty as he approached the warehouse door.

He knocked.

One of Garret's guards opened it a crack, his scarred face suspicious. "What do you—"

Corvus spoke the incantation for Hex, his fingers tracing sigils in the air. The curse lanced out invisible and virulent, sinking into the guard's consciousness like a poisoned nail. Immediately, the man's pupils dilated, his breathing becoming labored as invisible pressure built behind his eyes. Wisdom—the ability to perceive, to intuit danger—began to crumble under the hex's relentless assault.

Corvus didn't wait for the guard to recover. He shoulder-checked the door, sending the cursed man stumbling backward, then stepped into the warehouse with his hands already moving through another casting.

The interior was lit by alchemical lanterns that cast harsh shadows across crates and contraband. Garret stood in the center of the space: a lean, dangerous man with a glass prosthetic eye that caught the light like a mirror. His remaining natural eye widened as he recognized Corvus.

"The Middleman," Garret said, and his voice carried the rough confidence of a man who'd killed before and would again. "Should've known you'd—"

Corvus gestured, and his spectral hand—the invisible force granted by Mage Hand—swept across the nearest lantern, snuffing it. Then the next. Then the next. In three seconds, the warehouse plunged into darkness absolute, and Garret's curse cut off in a yelp of surprise.

"Get him!" Garret roared. "He's by the—"

Corvus spoke the word for Mind Sliver. The psychic assault was surgical and brutal: a spike of pure mental agony that drove through Garret's skull like a nail through rotten wood. The fixer screamed, his hands flying to his temples, and Corvus felt the magic take hold—felt Garret's thoughts scatter into incoherence, his ability to coordinate defense dissolving.

But the other guards were moving now, their shapes silhouettes against the faint light from the ventilation slits. One rushed forward with a club raised, his trajectory targeting where Corvus's voice had originated.

Corvus spoke another word—Shield—and the air before him crystallized into invisible force. The club struck it with a sound like iron on stone, and the shock traveled up the guard's arm, breaking his wrist. He went down screaming.

Now Corvus moved. Not with the frenetic chaos of panic but with the methodical precision of a surgeon working by candlelight. His dagger found the next guard's kidney, punching through leather and into meat. The man folded. Another guard fired a crossbow, but Corvus's Heroic Inspiration had already placed him three steps left of where he'd been—the bolt whispered past his ear and buried itself in a crate.

He reached Garret in the darkness, and the fixer tried to swing his own blade, but the Hex had done its work: the man's spatial awareness was compromised, his depth perception shattered. The strike went wide. Corvus caught Garret's wrist, twisted it with brutal efficiency, and drove his knee into the man's solar plexus.

Garret went down retching.

The remaining guards had had enough. Two of them fled through the door, their silhouettes disappearing into the Undervault's labyrinth. The last stood frozen, his sword trembling in his grip.

"Run," Corvus said quietly, and the man did.

Silence descended, broken only by Garret's labored breathing and Naivara's quiet sobs. Corvus lit one of the fallen lanterns with a whispered cantrip, and warm light spread across the carnage: one dead, one with a shattered wrist, and Garret curled on the floor with blood running from his nose and ears—the physical manifestation of psychic trauma.

Corvus cut Naivara free. She collapsed against him, weeping with relief, and he felt... nothing. Not satisfaction, not guilt, just the cold assessment that she was an asset successfully recovered.

Garret groaned, his good eye rolling toward Corvus with hatred that could have melted iron. "You... bastard... Baroness will... gut you..."

"No," Corvus said, and opened the Book of Shadows. He placed the manuscript fragments beside it, then used Prestidigitation to clean the blood from his hands and clothes—minor magic, but the symbolism mattered. He needed to be presentable for what came next.

From his cloak, he produced the three pages he'd stolen from the Shadowed Athenaeum: the original fragments from *The King in Yellow*. With methodical care, he tucked them into Garret's jacket, then placed the half-translated manuscript back into Naivara's satchel.

"What are you—" Garret's voice broke into a coughing fit.

"Creating a narrative," Corvus said. "You stole from the Shadowed Athenaeum. You kidnapped a Guild curator. And when the Shadow Guard finds you—which they will, because I'm about to send them an anonymous tip—they'll discover the evidence on your person."

He leaned closer, his voice dropping to a whisper that carried across the warehouse like a funeral bell. "The Code of Chains, Garret. You broke contract with the Enclave. That means no merchant will trade with you, no inn will shelter you, and no guard will protect you. You'll be ghost-marked within the day, and by week's end, you'll wish the Shadow Syndicate had found you first."

Garret's face went gray with understanding. Corvus saw the moment the man's mind broke—not violently, but with the quiet finality of a bridge collapsing into dark water. The fixer's remaining eye went distant and hollow, all the fight leaking out of him like blood from a severed artery.

Corvus stood, helped Naivara to her feet, and guided her toward the door. Behind them, Garret lay in the spreading pool of his own ruin, making small animal sounds that might have been sobs or laughter or both.

"Thank you," Naivara whispered as they emerged into the Undervaults' dim passages. "Thank you, thank you—"

"Don't," Corvus said flatly. "This was business."

But she kept thanking him anyway, her words washing over him like rain on stone, and Corvus felt nothing at all.

## VIII

The Shadow Guard arrested Garret six hours later, hauling him from the warehouse still clutching his broken mind. By morning, the ghost-marks appeared on notice boards throughout the Shadowbazaar: *Garret the Glass-Eyed, breaker of contracts, violator of the Code, marked for shunning by decree of the Infernal Contract Guild.*

No one would speak to him. No one would trade with him. In Veilport, that was death delayed—slow starvation of resources and connections until only suicide or exile remained.

Corvus delivered Naivara and the translated fragments to Baroness Xandrine that afternoon. The Baroness received him in her Veilheart estate's private study, her sulfurous eyes bright with satisfaction.

"Exceptional work," she said, counting out fifteen hundred gold crowns—triple the promised rate. "I'd heard you were competent. I didn't realize you were surgical."

"Efficiency is its own morality," Corvus replied, and pocketed the gold without counting it. To count would suggest doubt, and he never doubted his calculations.

"The Glass-Eyed was found in a... diminished state. The chirurgeons say his mind may not recover." Xandrine's smile was the expression of a satisfied predator. "What did you do to him?"

"I showed him the cost of competing with professionals." Corvus met her gaze without flinching. "Is there anything else, Baroness?"

"Actually, yes." She produced a small brass key worked with infernal sigils. "This grants you access to the Veilheart at any hour, no questions asked. Consider it a retainer—I suspect I'll have use for your services again."

Corvus took the key, bowed with precise formality, and left. The guards at the Veilheart's outer gates—the same guards who would have turned him away as Duskway trash a week ago—now nodded with the wary respect reserved for those who wielded the Baroness's favor.

He walked through the noble district's marble streets as sunset painted the sky the color of old blood. His fine clothes were immaculate, his face composed, his ledger full of transactions that had reshaped his world. In one week, he'd gone from desperate charlatan to the Baroness's retained asset, armed with power that transcended human limitations.

Back in his Duskway apartment, Corvus opened the Book of Shadows and made his final notation:

*Garret eliminated. Naivara recovered. Contract fulfilled. Total profit: 1,500 gold crowns, Veilheart access, Baroness's patronage.*

*Cost: One rival's sanity. One curator's trauma. One child abandoned to fate. Total erosion of empathy: Absolute.*

The book's pages seemed to shimmer, and Corvus heard that vast laughter again—distant now, but always watching. The King in Yellow's voice whispered from spaces between his thoughts:

**THE LEDGER FILLS NICELY, LITTLE MIDDLEMAN. EACH TRANSACTION BRINGS US CLOSER TO SETTLEMENT. AND WHEN THE TIME COMES, WHEN YOU HAVE WRITTEN YOUR NAME IN DEEDS TOO TERRIBLE TO IGNORE, I SHALL COLLECT WHAT IS OWED.**

**BUT FOR NOW... CONTINUE. THE CITY OF WHISPERED BARGAINS BELONGS TO THOSE WHO CONTROL THE SILENCE.**

**AND BUSINESS IS GOOD.**

Corvus closed the book, extinguished his lamp, and sat in darkness that no longer frightened him. He'd traded his humanity for competence, his conscience for power, his soul for the ability to survive in a world that devoured weakness.

The ledger was balanced.

And he felt nothing at all.

*—End—*
