### **10\. Backstory: The Middleman of Duskway**

Corvus was born in the "Duskway" residential ward of Veilport, the son of failed human merchants who were crushed by the weight of Shadowkin monopolies. Early on, he realized that power in the City of Whispered Bargains didn't belong to the buyer or the seller, but to the person standing between them. He rebranded himself as "The Middleman," the invisible link who could procure any forbidden reagent or "adjust" any trade dispute for a fee.

While working as a minor scribe in the "Warlock’s Enclave," Corvus made accidental contact with an alien intelligence—Hastur, the King in Yellow—while archiving forbidden theater manuscripts in the Shadowed Athenaeum. The contact didn't break his mind; it sharpened it. He realized that his role as the Middleman was the perfect cover for a "Silent Broker"—a psionic predator who rewrites the very contracts held in his clients' minds.

Corvus now operates in the "Shadowbazaar" as a highly sought-after neutral party. He presents himself as a professional, clinical human functionary, but his true goal is to infiltrate the Shadow Syndicate by harvesting the secrets he "facilitates." He maintains a "Wealthy" lifestyle to glide through the noble "Veilheart" district unchallenged, his Book of Shadows always disguised as a simple, mundane trade ledger.

### **11\. Operational Protocol**

* **Social Interaction**: Use Guidance cantrip before major negotiations or Influence actions. Heroic Inspiration as guaranteed reroll on failed Deception/Insight checks — ensures critical lies succeed in Veilport's deadly intrigue.  
* **Combat**: Stay backline. Eldritch Blast for damage, Mind Sliver to debuff saves, Hex for extra damage/debuff. Shield reaction if hit.  
* **Development Plan (Strict Guide Alignment)**:  
  * **Level 2**: Magical Cunning (partial slot recovery). Invocations: Mask of Many Faces (at-will Disguise Self for infiltration) \+ Agonizing Blast (add Cha to Eldritch Blast damage — combat viability).  
  * **Later progression**: Level 4 Actor feat (Cha 18 \+ mimicry), Level 5 Gaze of Two Minds (proxy warfare), Level 7 One with Shadows, Level 8 ASI Cha 20, Level 9 Whispers of the Grave, Level 12 War Caster.

### **12\. Active Syndicate Targets**

* **Baroness Xandrine von Mephistopheles (Tiefling)**: A high-ranking council member of the Shadow Syndicate. Corvus is currently acting as her intermediary for "off-book" blood-gem shipments. He is siphoning her encryption ciphers while she believes he is merely a loyal scribe.  
* **"The Glass-Eyed" Garret (Human)**: A rival fixer in the Shadowbazaar who relies on traditional blackmail. Corvus views him as obsolete. The goal is to psychically compromise Garret's primary informants so they begin feeding him false data, eventually leading to Garret's "retirement."  
* **Curator Naivara (Elf)**: A scholar at the Shadowed Athenaeum. Corvus has convinced her that he is researching legal precedents for the Syndicate. In reality, he is using her to track down the missing "Yellow Sign" fragments buried within the library’s restricted vaults.
