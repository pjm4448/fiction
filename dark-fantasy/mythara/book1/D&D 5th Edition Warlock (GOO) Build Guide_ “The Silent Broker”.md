\# D\&D 5th Edition Warlock (GOO) Build Guide: “The Silent Broker”

\*\*Neutral Evil Great Old One Warlock | Arcanum Epoch Edition\*\*    
\*\*Fully Compatible with 2024 Player's Handbook – Corrected Version\*\*

\#\# 1\. Introduction and Strategic Overview

Veilport runs on secrets, contracts, and shadow influence. Overt displays of power mark you as crude; true masters manipulate from the dark. The Silent Broker is a Human Warlock bound to a Great Old One (GOO), specializing in undetectable psionic control in a city where visible spellcasting invites execution.

This corrected guide optimizes a Neutral Evil Human GOO Warlock using only the 2024 Player's Handbook rules, excelling in social intrigue through silent psychic domination.

\#\#\# 1.1 The Thesis of the Whispering Broker

The 2024 GOO subclass centers on psionic enchantment and illusion. Psychic Spells removes Verbal and Somatic components from Warlock Enchantment or Illusion spells (including patron spells like Dissonant Whispers, Tasha's Hideous Laughter, Phantasmal Force, and Confusion). In anti-magic Veilport, this allows mind influence that looks like natural persuasion, madness, or coincidence.

Humans appear as outsiders in tiefling-dominated Veilport, benefiting from underestimation—pose as a scholar while deploying powers disguised as "psionic anomalies."

\#\#\# 1.2 The Neutral Evil Paradigm in Veilport

Neutral Evil thrives in Veilport's profit-driven hierarchy. The Broker exploits rules opportunistically, aligning with syndicates only to subvert them. GOO pacts evoke aberrant heresy, demanding covert operation.

\#\# 3\. Great Old One Subclass Features (2024 PHB)

\#\#\# 3.1 Patron Spells (Always Prepared)

| Level | Spells                          |  
|-------|---------------------------------|  
| 1     | Dissonant Whispers, Tasha's Hideous Laughter |  
| 3     | Detect Thoughts, Phantasmal Force |  
| 5     | Clairvoyance, Hunger of Hadar   |  
| 7     | Confusion, Summon Aberration    |  
| 9     | Modify Memory, Telekinesis      |

\*\*Note\*\*: All Enchantment and Illusion spells above become silent via Psychic Spells (Dissonant Whispers, Tasha's Hideous Laughter, Phantasmal Force, Confusion, Modify Memory).

\#\#\# 3.2 Core Class Features  
\- \*\*Level 3: Awakened Mind\*\* — Bonus Action telepathic link with a seen creature (30 ft). Two-way communication. Essential for secure coordination.  
\- \*\*Level 3: Psychic Spells\*\* — You can choose to deal Psychic damage. Most importantly: No Verbal or Somatic components for Warlock Enchantment/Illusion spells.  
\- \*\*Level 6: Clairvoyant Combatant\*\* — Use Awakened Mind to force a Wisdom save. On fail, target has disadvantage vs. you, and you have advantage vs. them.  
\- \*\*Level 10: Eldritch Hex & Thought Shield\*\* — Hex enhanced to impose disadvantage on saves for a chosen ability. Thought Shield grants psychic resistance and unreadable thoughts.  
\- \*\*Level 14: Create Thrall\*\* — When you cast Summon Aberration, you can modify it so that it doesn’t require Concentration (duration becomes 1 minute), and the aberration gains temporary Hit Points equal to your Warlock level \+ your Charisma modifier.

\#\# 4\. Eldritch Invocations & Feat Progression

\#\#\# Eldritch Invocations  
\- \*\*Level 2\*\*: Pact of the Tome (Guidance/Message/Rituals), Agonizing Blast, Mask of Many Faces.  
\- \*\*Level 5\*\*: Gaze of Two Minds (Cast spells through a proxy’s senses).  
\- \*\*Level 7\*\*: One with Shadows (Invisibility in dim light/darkness).  
\- \*\*Level 9\*\*: Whispers of the Grave (Speak with Dead at will).

\#\#\# Feats  
\- \*\*Level 1 (Human)\*\*: Magic Initiate (Wizard) (Mage Hand, Prestidigitation, Shield).  
\- \*\*Level 1 (Background)\*\*: Skilled.  
\- \*\*Level 4\*\*: Actor (+1 Cha to 18; Advantage on impersonation, mimicry).  
\- \*\*Level 8\*\*: ASI (+2 Cha to 20).  
\- \*\*Level 12\*\*: War Caster (Advantage on Concentration).

\#\# 5\. Enhanced Patron Spell Tactics: Psychic Manipulation

\#\#\# Low-Level Core Tools (Levels 3–4)  
\- \*\*Dissonant Whispers (Shadowbazaar Chaos)\*\*: Silently cast on a rival bidder during a high-stakes auction. They scream and flee; you buy the item for a pittance while onlookers blame "market stress."  
\- \*\*Tasha's Hideous Laughter (Veilheart Humiliation)\*\*: Target a boastful priest mid-sermon. They collapse laughing, appearing drunk or possessed, allowing you to plant forged evidence in the ensuing confusion.

\#\#\# Mid-Level Intrusions (Levels 5–10)  
\- \*\*Detect Thoughts (Guild Infiltration)\*\*: Pose as a clerk via Mask of Many Faces. Probe a rival's mind during routine paperwork to extract their True Name for leverage.  
\- \*\*Phantasmal Force (Paranoia Campaign)\*\*: Make a target believe they are being stalked by aberrations. Over time, their erratic behavior ruins their credibility, leaving you to step into their vacated position.  
\- \*\*Summon Aberration (Levels 7+)\*\*: Deploy an aberrant horror for deniable intimidation or assassination while maintaining plausible separation.

\#\#\# High-Level Domination (Levels 11+)  
\- \*\*Confusion\*\*: Silent crowd suppression. Bewilder guards or a group of rivals, causing random behavior or attacks on allies; they cannot coordinate effectively amid the induced madness.  
\- \*\*Modify Memory\*\*: Alter a target's recollection of events to erase evidence of your involvement or implant false loyalties.  
\- \*\*Summon Aberration (Level 14+)\*\*: Send a "no-concentration" horror (with temporary HP) to eliminate a target while you sit visibly in a teahouse across the city.

\#\# 6\. Signature Advanced Combos

1\. \*\*The Eldritch Debuff Loop (Level 10+)\*\*    
   \- Silent Eldritch Hex (choose Wisdom) on a target during a conversation.    
   \- Silent Phantasmal Force, Confusion, or Tasha's Laughter.    
   \- Target saves at disadvantage, making your "silent" madness almost impossible to resist.

2\. \*\*Proxy Domination (Level 5+)\*\*    
   \- Use Gaze of Two Minds through your Tome familiar (e.g., a raven).    
   \- Send the familiar into a secure meeting.    
   \- Cast Phantasmal Force through the bird to manifest false evidence only the boss can see.

3\. \*\*Impersonation Sabotage (Level 4+)\*\*    
   \- Mask of Many Faces \+ Actor to look and sound like a rival.    
   \- Silent Dissonant Whispers on their allies.    
   \- Drop disguise; the original rival takes the blame for the unprovoked "psychic assault."

\#\# 7\. Level Progression Summary

| Tier | Levels | Focus                                                                 |  
|------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| 1    | 1–4    | Establishing the persona. Silent Hideous Laughter is your primary social weapon. |  
| 2    | 5–10   | Remote operations. Gaze of Two Minds, Clairvoyance, and Summon Aberration let you rule from afar. |  
| 3    | 11–16  | True domination. No-concentration summons and Modify Memory provide deniable lethality and perfect cover. |  
| 4    | 17–20  | Planar influence. Use Mystic Arcanum for city-wide shifts in reality. |

\*\*Final Note\*\*: In Veilport, the Broker needs no words—only the patron's inevitable whispers. By the time they realize you are the source of their madness, you already own the contracts.
