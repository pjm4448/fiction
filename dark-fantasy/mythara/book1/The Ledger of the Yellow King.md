Here is a short story outline for **Corvus "The Middleman"** that utilizes the **Dark Fantasy Villain Protagonist Structure** while strictly adhering to the **2024 Player’s Handbook** rules and the provided **World Bible** lore for Veilport.

### **Story Title:** The Ledger of the Yellow King

**Theme:** The cost of competence is the erosion of humanity.**Protagonist:** Corvus (Level 1 Human Warlock, Charlatan Background).**Antagonist:** "The Glass-Eyed" Garret (Rival Fixer).**Target:** Baroness Xandrine von Mephistopheles (The Mark).

### Act I: The Setup (The Wound and the False Belief)

**1\. The Cold Open: Aesthetic of the Professional**

* **Setting:** A private booth in *The Silken Dagger* (Veilport brothel/info hub).  
* **Action:** Corvus is preparing for a high-stakes negotiation. The narrative focuses on his "precision of language" and gear. He adjusts his **Fine Clothes** and organizes his trade ledger.  
* **Competence Display:** A desperate merchant tries to shortchange him. Corvus uses his **Insight** (Human proficiency) to read the merchant's "tell"—a twitch of the left eye. He calmly dismantles the merchant’s lie using logic and leverage, not violence.  
* **The Internal Monologue (The Lie):** Corvus reflects on his parents, failed merchants crushed by Shadowkin monopolies in the **Duskway**. He establishes his False Belief: *“Morality is a luxury of the wealthy; competence is the only currency that matters.”*

**2\. The Inciting Incident: The Impossible Job**

* **The Offer:** **Baroness Xandrine** (a Mephistopheles-bloodline tiefling) needs a discreet intermediary to acquire a fragment of a Pre-Cataclysmic play from the **Shadowed Athenaeum** without alerting the **Shadow Syndicate**.  
* **The Stakes:** "The Glass-Eyed" Garret is also bidding for the job. If Corvus fails, he remains a "duskway rat." If he succeeds, he gains entry to the **Veilheart** (Noble Quarter).  
* **The Problem:** Corvus lacks the raw magical power to bypass the Athenaeum’s wards. He needs an edge.

**3\. The Plot Point: The Occult Ceremony**

* **Scene:** Corvus infiltrates the restricted archives of the **Warlock's Enclave** at night, ostensibly to research trade routes. He finds the forbidden theater manuscript.  
* **The Event:** As he touches the yellow-bound tome, reality warps. He isn't praying; he is negotiating.  
* **The Pact (Required Plot):** *“Through occult ceremony, you have formed a pact with a mysterious entity to gain magical powers. The entity is a voice in the shadows—its identity unclear—but its boon to you is concrete: the ability to cast spells.”*  
* **The Result:** The voice (Hastur) grants him the **Pact of the Tome**. Corvus’s mundane ledger transforms into a **Book of Shadows**, containing the **Guidance** and **Message** cantrips. He now has the tools to cheat the system.

### Act II: The Descent (The OODA Loop & Tactical Narrative)

**4\. Preparation: The "Hard" System Application**

* **The Plan:** Corvus cannot out-muscle Garret’s thugs. He must use "asymmetric warfare." He applies **Guidance** (from his Book of Shadows) to himself before every social maneuver to ensure mathematical superiority.  
* **The Heist Crew (Solo Variation):** Corvus uses **Find Familiar** (Ritual from Pact of the Tome) to summon a spider. This serves as his "Inside Man," scouting Garret’s safehouse in the **Upper Undervaults**.  
* **Technobabble:** Corvus analyzes the "arcane resonance" of the Baroness’s encryption ciphers using **Arcana**, treating magic as a computational tool to be exploited.

**5\. The Execution: The "Villain Save the Cat"**

* **Scene:** The Shadowbazaar Night Market.  
* **Action:** Garret’s thugs corner a young pickpocket who works for Corvus.  
* **The Twist:** Corvus intervenes, not out of mercy, but efficiency. He casts **Charm Person** on the lead thug. Because he does not yet have *Psychic Spells* (Level 3), he must mask the Verbal/Somatic components. He uses the noise of the market and a sleight-of-hand gesture to cast the spell.  
* **The Villainy:** He saves the kid, but immediately demands the kid plant a stolen item on Garret later. The kid is a resource, not a person.

**6\. The Midpoint: The Plan Goes Sideways**

* **The Complication:** Garret anticipates Corvus. He hasn't stolen the manuscript; he has kidnapped the Curator, **Naivara**, forcing her to decrypt it for him.  
* **The OODA Loop:** Corvus realizes his "Decision Speed" was too slow. He must cycle faster. He uses **Heroic Inspiration** (Human trait) to reroll a failed initiative or perception check, symbolizing his refusal to leave his fate to chance.

### Act III: The Collapse (Dark Victory)

**7\. The Climax: A Cold Professional**

* **Scene:** A warehouse in the **Smuggler’s Highway** (Undervaults).  
* **Tactics:** Garret expects a duel. Corvus brings a massacre of the mind.  
* **Combat:**  
* Corvus casts **Hex** on Garret (disadvantage on Wisdom checks) to lower his perception.  
* He uses **Mage Hand** (Magic Initiate Feat) to extinguish the torches, plunging the room into darkness.  
* He casts **Mind Sliver** (Cantrip). The narrative describes not a magical blast, but a "psionic needle" inserting a headache that disrupts Garret’s focus.  
* When Garret lunges, Corvus casts **Shield** (Magic Initiate: Wizard), a "calculated deflection of force."

**8\. The Devastating Resolution**

* **The Act:** Corvus doesn't kill Garret. He uses **Prestidigitation** to clean his own clothes, then plants the *Yellow Sign* fragment on Garret.  
* **The Betrayal:** He alerts the **Shadow Guard**, framing Garret for the theft of the Baroness’s property. Garret is dragged away to the **Iron Spire**.  
* **The Cost:** Curator Naivara thanks Corvus, weeping. Corvus feels nothing. He opens his **Book of Shadows** and logs the transaction: *One rival removed. One patron secured. Net profit: Absolute.*

**9\. The Ending Image: The Silent Broker**

* **Setting:** The Veilheart. Corvus walks past the guards who would have stopped him yesterday.  
* **Theme Stated:** He touches the ledger. The voice of Hastur whispers from the book, no longer a mystery, but a business partner.  
* **Closing Line:** "The City of Whispered Bargains belongs to those who control the silence. And business is good."

### Key Rules & Lore Integration Checklist:

* **x Level 1 Mechanics:** Uses *Pact of the Tome* (Level 1 Invocation in 2024 rules), *Magic Initiate* (Human Origin Feat), and *Heroic Inspiration*.  
* **x Lore:** References the *Shadowed Athenaeum*, *Veilport’s* anti-magic stigma, and the *Code of Chains*.  
* **x Structure:** Follows the "Corruption Arc"—Corvus achieves his goal but loses his moral compass, viewing people as assets in a ledger.  
* **x Required Plot:** The occult ceremony is the pivot point in Act I that transitions him from a mundane charlatan to a Warlock.
