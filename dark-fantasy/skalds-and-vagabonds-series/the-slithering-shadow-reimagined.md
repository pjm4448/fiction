# The Slithering Shadow Reimagined

**Summary**

In the scorched ruins of Istara, Conan, a fierce Cimmerian mercenary, rescues noblewoman Natala from a brutal siege, pursued by a scarred Kushite warrior into the merciless deserts south of Koth. Guided by Natala’s cryptic knowledge of Xuthal, a fabled city of lost dreams, they stumble upon its eerie jade-green walls, pulsing with otherworldly light. Hope turns to dread as Xuthal reveals itself as a trap, alive with sinister will and guarded by a sorrowful force. Joined by Thalis, a cunning Stygian outcast with her own vendetta, they confront Kherm, the city’s Dream-Master, whose grief-fueled sorcery binds its dreamers in eternal slumber. As Thog, a cosmic horror from the Outer Dark stirs beneath, Conan’s sword, Natala’s resolve, and Thalis’s forbidden arts are their only hope in a labyrinth of shifting stone and spectral foes. Every step risks unraveling Xuthal’s fragile dream—and its horrors. Will their defiance break the city’s curse, or will they become its eternal prisoners?

## Prologue: The Siege of Istara and the Flight South

The air in Istara, Prince Almuric's last stronghold, was thick with the coppery scent of blood and the screams of the dying. Conan, fighting as a mercenary captain for Almuric, felt the familiar rage boil as the lines broke. He saw Almuric, a flamboyant fool but brave, go down under a storm of arrows. Amidst the slaughter, Conan's eye caught Natala, daughter of a Brythunian envoy, her fine silks torn, being dragged by grim-faced Kushite warriors. One, a hulking brute with a ritual scar branding his cheek like a crawling centipede, met Conan's gaze with cold fury. With a roar that echoed the battle's din, Conan carved a path, his greatsword a whirlwind of death, and snatched Natala from their grasp. "Hold tight, girl\!" he'd bellowed, swinging her onto his powerful shoulders as he fought clear of the city's flaming ruins. The scarred Kushite lunged in pursuit, but a collapsing battlement, undermined by siege engines, cut him off with a roar of stone. Conan didn't look back.

Their escape was a desperate flight into the sun-scorched deserts south of Koth. Weeks bled into each other, marked by dwindling supplies and the vast, indifferent sky. Natala, stripped of her noble comforts, had revealed an unexpected core of resilience. Her father, a keen scholar despite his diplomatic duties, had often shared his studies with her. She recalled long hours in his dusty library, not merely listening, but actively helping decipher fragmented Stygian stelae and puzzling over diagrams of ancient mechanisms, her nimble fingers tracing faded glyphs that spoke of forgotten ages and perilous ruins. It was from these shared hours, surrounded by the scent of ancient parchment, that she now drew a strange comfort and a nascent skill.

One evening, huddled by a meager fire, its shadows dancing like spectral figures, she spoke, her voice raspy.

"My father... he had maps, whispers of lost cities. One, Xuthal... he called it the 'City of the Last Dream,' accursed and hidden." She paused, the memory bringing a chill despite the desert heat. "He never found proof, only tales of a place where reality itself was... thin, and of a guardian consumed by an ancient sorrow." As she spoke the name, a fleeting image of immense, cold structures under an unfamiliar sky, like a pressure against his temples, brushed Conan's mind, accompanied by a whisper so faint it might have been the wind: "Mine... all that's left of her world..." He dismissed it with a grunt as weariness and the desert playing tricks, placing a reassuring hand briefly on her shoulder. "We survived Istara's fires, girl. We'll face what comes." Natala nodded, but her eyes reflected the firelight with a new, hardened glint. The softness of the court was gone, replaced by the grim focus of a survivor.

## Chapter 1: City of Whispering Stone

The desert was a shimmering hell. Conan squinted against the sun, lips cracked. Beside him, Natala rasped, "Water..." He shook the empty canteen. He'd given her the last drops hours ago.

Then, a glimmer on the horizon. Conan's eyes, accustomed to the desert's deceptions, narrowed. These were no shimmering mirages of sun-baked rock. The distant spires pierced the heat haze with an unsettling, geometric precision, their very stillness an affront to the wavering air. An odd prickle ran down his spine, a warning older than words, a sense of profound wrongness emanating from those distant, silent shapes. "A city?" Natala breathed, her voice a mixture of hope and a dread that echoed Conan's sudden unease. "Xuthal...?"

As dusk painted the sky in bruised purples and reds, the city resolved itself. Massive walls of smooth, greenish, almost translucent stone loomed, their surface eerily like jade, radiating a faint, internal, sickly light. Conan thought he saw patterns shift within the stone, like veins, or perhaps distant, sorrowful constellations. No guards, no banners. An unnerving stillness hung in the air, a silence so profound it felt like a held breath, broken only by a faint, almost sub-audible thrumming that seemed to emanate from the very stones. Conan hammered on the colossal gate. The sound was swallowed, absorbed by the strange stone. With a silent, unnerving ease, the gate swung inward, revealing a vast courtyard.

Sprawled in the dust lay a man in faded purple silk, a curved sword beside him. His skin was sallow, stretched taut over sharp cheekbones, and a faint, sweetish odor of decay, like overripe fruit mixed with something metallic, clung to him. Near his outstretched hand, a small, intricately carved star-ship miniature lay half-buried. Conan approached, saber drawn. He touched the man's flesh. Cold. No visible wounds, but the man's eyes were sunken, the flesh around them bruised as if from lack of true rest. As Conan touched him, an unnatural coldness emanated from the body. A wave of profound, inexplicable melancholy washed over Conan, cold and vast as a dying star, then was gone, leaving him with a scowl and a tightened grip on his sword. He shook his head, growling low in his throat. Sorcery, he thought, or the madness of this place.

Before them, a towering edifice. Carved into its jade-like façade was a vast mural, surprisingly preserved. It depicted a world of graceful, crystalline cities under a sky lit by twin suns, inhabited by slender, ethereal beings. Then, the mural shifted to scenes of fiery destruction, a dark, coiling hunger swallowing stars, and the same beings fleeing in ships that mirrored the alien plaything by the fallen man. One panel showed a colossal, shadowy entity with a single, baleful eye—a pinprick of ruby fire in a vortex of shifting blackness—its form a mass of undulating, amorphous limbs, being chained by these figures—a being of primal, devouring hunger. Natala traced a glyph. "This... this script is archaic, but I've seen something similar... it speaks of a 'Star-Thief,' bound by the city's founders." Her hand trembled slightly. The air itself seemed to hum with a faint, disquieting energy, a subtle vibration that resonated through the soles of their boots. A faint, almost inaudible whisper seemed to brush past Conan's ear, too indistinct to be words, yet carrying a tone of possessive warning: "Disturb not the dream... my last sanctuary... my child sleeps here, safe from the waking void..." Kherm... the name echoed in his mind again, this time with a chilling clarity, a sense of being watched by something ancient and despairing.

Beyond the fallen man, towering edifices of green stone, their domes and minarets unsettling in their alien geometry. In the center of the courtyard, a well. "The well first," Conan growled, his throat parched. As he turned, Natala screamed. The "dead" man was on his feet, eyes blazing with an eerie, puppet-like light, sword whistling towards Conan's back.

## Chapter 2: The Dreamers of Xuthal

Conan spun, saber parrying with a clang that echoed unnaturally in the silent courtyard. Steel rang. The attacker fought with a dream-like clumsiness, his movements subtly controlled, telegraphed, yet with an unnerving persistence that made evasion tricky. Conan, noting the Xuthalite's poor footing, used a jutting paving stone to unbalance him. A feint, a sidestep, and his heavy blade bit deep. The man hissed, amber eyes wide with inhuman surprise. "Kherm... forgive..." he sighed, a sound less of pain and more of a fading connection, the light in his eyes extinguishing. A whisper, cold and filled with an ancient grief, brushed Conan's mind: "Another of my children... lost to the waking void... why do they seek to wake her from her perfect dream?"

"His mind, Conan\!" Natala cried, fear and dawning understanding sharpening her senses. "Their spirits... they're not truly here\! Something controls them\!" Snatching a loose paving stone, she struck the Xuthalite's knee with desperate force. He wailed, a thin, reedy sound. Conan silenced him with a swift blow from his pommel, then heaved the unconscious form over the well's edge. A distant splash. "No witnesses." A subtle chill permeated the air, a fleeting sense of icy disapproval, then receded. Natala shivered. "Did you feel that? It's... like a vast, desperate sorrow, trying to hold onto something precious." Conan felt it too, a psychic pressure that sought to instill despair, a voice in his mind whispering of loss and the futility of struggle. He shook it off with a snarl.

"We need water," Conan said, though the oppressive sense of being watched lingered, stirring an unease in him that went beyond the usual caution sorcery inspired. "And answers."

Inside a massive structure, they found a vast chamber hung with tapestries depicting otherworldly landscapes under bizarre skies. The green stone walls were inlaid with gold in intricate, unsettling patterns. Natala examined another mural: the colossal, shadowy, many-limbed horror from the entrance, its single eye now depicted as a pit of smoldering embers reflecting a universe of pain, now clearly labeled with glyphs she struggled to decipher. "Thog," she breathed, the name feeling alien and heavy on her tongue. "The Slithering Shadow. The Star-Thief." As she spoke, the air grew cold. The shadow in the mural seemed to ripple, and a faint, oily scent, a mixture of decay and something akin to charred stardust, touched their nostrils. A wave of ancient hunger seemed to emanate from the depiction, making Natala recoil. Conan, too, felt unease, a primitive instinct to flee, the very stones seeming to hum with silent warnings. From the shadowy corners of the room, he thought he saw movement, like dark oil seeping from the walls, only to vanish when he looked directly—always accompanied by that faint, almost subliminal thrumming that seemed to be Thog's very breath. A sudden, sharp pain lanced through Conan's temple, and for a heartbeat, he saw a vision: a child's toy, the cherished star-ship model, clutched in a despairing hand, then a universe of cold, empty void. He blinked, the vision gone, replaced by a dull ache and Kherm's name echoing once more, this time tinged with a possessive anger: "They seek to unravel all that remains... my little star-sailor... the last memory of her laughter..."

"These glyphs," Natala continued, her voice hushed, "they speak of a 'Heart-Stone,' an anchor against the 'Outer Dark'—Thog, imprisoned beneath the city. And Kherm... he is its guardian, or perhaps its master, using it to sustain Xuthal." She pointed to a smaller, adjacent symbol. "And this... 'Breath of Life,' an essence... to bolster guardians, dispel shadows." Natala paused, then added, "Father had theories... he found a fragmented Stygian text that spoke of 'Ka-Stones,' anchors of reality supposedly brought by star-wanderers in the age before the Serpent-folk, used to bind entities from the Outer Dark. He wondered if Xuthal's stone was one such artifact, perhaps even a flawed or corrupted one."

Cushions on the floor bore fresh imprints. A cloying perfume, like black lotus and ancient metal, hung heavy. "Someone was here recently," Conan muttered, his hand on his sword. The palace was a labyrinth of silent halls and echoing chambers. As they moved deeper, they passed an archway leading to a dimly lit hall. Inside, dozens of Xuthalites lay on silken couches, motionless. Their forms shimmered faintly, and around them, dream-like constructs flickered—fragments of landscapes, impossible creatures, scenes of serene joy or stark terror, all shifting and reforming. Their skin was pale and waxy, their bodies unnaturally thin. Around some dreamers, the flickering constructs wove visions of unearthly beauty—lithe figures draped in translucent silks that shimmered like moonlight, their movements a languid dance that beckoned with promises of eternal ecstasy. The air pulsed with their silent invitations, a siren’s lure that made Conan’s hand tighten on his sword, his barbarian soul recoiling from the unnatural sweetness that masked a deeper rot. Limbs like brittle sticks. A few twitched, faint moans escaping their lips, their faces contorted in unseen nightmares despite the placid dream-images flickering around them. It was a tableau of decadent oblivion, the sweet, heavy scent of the Black Lotus cloying in the air. Conan grunted, a Cimmerian's distaste for such unnatural passivity. One of the dreamers stirred, its spectral hand reaching out, almost brushing Natala. Conan instinctively pulled her back. "Careful. This place is a trap for the mind, and a grave for the body." Suddenly, a grotesque, insectoid creature, woven from shadows and flickering dream-light, detached itself from one of the sleeping forms and lunged at Natala with a chitinous screech. Conan's blade flashed, cleaving the dream-construct. It dissolved into wisps of smoke and a lingering scent of ozone and something like burnt honey. The dreamer it had sprung from moaned louder, thrashing briefly.

In another chamber, a table held exotic foods and goblets filled with a crimson liquid. Natala hesitated. "Conan... the Black Lotus, source of their dreams, and their decay. Its scent is so strong here... it makes my head swim."

Conan's stomach growled. "If it's poisoned, we die with full bellies." He drained a goblet. The liquid was tangy, invigorating. As the crimson liquid touched his tongue, a fleeting vision danced before Conan’s eyes: silken limbs entwined in a haze of lotus-scent, a whisper of pleasure that promised oblivion. His Cimmerian will clamped down, shattering the illusion, but the heat lingered in his veins, a siren’s call he growled away. Beside him, Natala’s cheeks flushed, her breath quickening as the Lotus’s perfume wove a fleeting fantasy of soft caresses and forgotten courts, before she shook it off, her scholar’s discipline anchoring her. He attacked the food with gusto. Natala, after a moment's hesitation, joined him, though she ate sparingly, eyeing the food with suspicion. For a moment, as the rich flavors spread through her, a wave of pleasant lethargy washed over her, a desire to simply rest, to let the soft dream-images of Xuthal claim her. She shook her head, pushing the feeling away.

Weariness settled over Conan despite the food, a subtle, dream-like haze trying to dull his senses. He fought it off with a scowl. Natala was restless. "This place feels wrong, Conan. Too quiet, yet... alive." A soft, slithering rustle came from an adjoining corridor, accompanied by a faint, chilling carillon, like wind through ice chimes. The very walls seemed to hum. Conan was on his feet, saber ready. In the gloom, another vast chamber. On a dais, a figure lay in elaborate robes. Sleeping? Or dead?

Then, a shadow detached itself from the deeper darkness. Huge, amorphous, a blot of blackness, its edges coiling like living smoke, its single, malevolent eye a void that seemed to drink the faint light, rimmed with a hateful, bloody luminescence. Primal dread prickled Conan's neck; the air grew colder, a faint, discordant piping echoing from the stones, the oppressive atmosphere thickening, carrying a scent like a charnel house mixed with the cold vacuum of space. Natala stifled a scream. The shadow flowed towards the dais, engulfing the sleeping form. Then, it receded, a hint of a monstrous, multi-limbed head briefly visible, before melting back into the darkness. The dais was empty. A single, glistening drop of dark fluid stained the silk. Even Conan felt a profound chill. "Crom's devils," he breathed. "What was that?" Before Natala could answer, a soft, human footfall sounded behind them.

## Chapter 3: Thalis of Stygia

A woman stepped into the chamber, tall and arrestingly beautiful, her ivory skin gleaming under the green-lumed jewels. Her midnight hair cascaded over bare shoulders, her only garment a jewel-encrusted girdle that clung to her hips, accentuating the sway of her curves. Her dark, almond-shaped eyes held a languid amusement, but beneath it, a predatory glint. “Well, well,” she purred in flawless Stygian, her voice a velvet caress that seemed to stroke Conan’s senses. Her full breasts, unrestrained, moved with each step, their rosy tips and pebbled nipples catching the faint light, a deliberate provocation that mocked the chamber’s oppressive gloom. "Unexpected guests. And one of them is a Cimmerian."

Conan's heated gaze raked over her lush figure hungrily, lingering on her bare breasts, but his hand stayed near his sword, wary of sorcery’s tricks. The sheer perfection of her womanly assets left him momentarily transfixed, pupils dilating with carnal desire. Natala’s breath caught, her scholar’s mind warring with a sudden, irrational pang of inadequacy before her resolve hardened.

Natala bristled. "Who are you?"

The woman smiled. "I am Thalis. And you, little Brythunian sparrow, have fire." Her gaze flicked to Conan. "You interest me, barbarian. Few find their way to Xuthal. Fewer remain... awake." As she spoke, her hand idly brushed her hip, where the coils of a serpent tattoo, intertwined with a stylized black lotus, were partially visible. She gave a slight, bitter twist of her lips as her fingers grazed the ink, a fleeting expression that hinted at a past she didn't cherish. "Some marks are deeper than skin," she murmured, almost to herself, a flicker of cold anger in her eyes before it vanished. "Especially those carved by priests who fancy themselves gods, like Nebthu of Stygia, who believed a 'gift' such as I should be... broken to his will."

"We met one of your Xuthalites," Conan growled. "He called on a master named Kherm. Seemed more like a puppet than man."

Thalis's eyebrows arched. "Kherm? The Dream-Master. His will dislikes disturbances in his grand, sorrowful play. He clings to his fading world with a grip that borders on madness." She glanced towards the empty dais. "And you saw... more?" A flicker of fear, quickly masked. "Ah, Thog. He grows restless. Its hunger is constant, and its presence frays the edges of Kherm's carefully constructed reality. Kherm prefers him quiescent; Thog's awakening might unravel Kherm's power, and the fragile dream of Xuthal he desperately preserves." She paused. "Thog is not merely hungry; it is an intelligence, ancient and cruel. It enjoys the fear, the unraveling... it toys with Kherm as much as it obeys him. Sometimes, the very stones of Xuthal weep an oily ichor not of Kherm's making, or the dreamers scream from nightmares even Kherm cannot soothe, a subtle mockery of his control that leaves him railing in the deeper chambers."

"Thog?" Natala whispered. "The Slithering Shadow... from the Outer Dark."

"The god of Xuthal," Thalis said, her voice low. "Or its unwilling prisoner. The founders wove the city's essence into a cage for the 'Sleeper Below.' The lights," Thalis indicated glowing jewels set into the walls, "are faint echoes of their power, a dying song." She gestured to faint inscriptions on a nearby pillar. "Kherm's people, the Khermi, fled a dying star-system—or a realm beyond mortal comprehension. They brought Thog, or it followed, a parasite of cosmic horror. They bound it here, but the binding weakened. Kherm, the last of his line, uses his own life-force, amplified by something they call the Heart-Stone, to maintain the city and keep Thog... mostly... chained." Thalis added with a knowing glint, "Stygian lore whispers of such 'World-Hearts,' remnants of pre-Cataclysmic civilizations who trafficked with powers from beyond. Nebthu himself covets any knowledge of them, believing them keys to ultimate dominion or utter destruction."

"The Black Lotus?" Natala asked. "Why do they all sleep?"

Thalis smiled sadly. "Xuthal's lifeblood. Or its poison. Most slumber eternally, lost in dreams Kherm curates. The Lotus dulls reality, making the chains of this place bearable for them, perhaps even for Kherm himself. Its influence is subtle, pervasive... it can even cloud the minds of those who think themselves resistant, if they are not careful." She gave Conan a knowing look.

"You know much," Conan observed. "And you are Stygian."

"A political pawn," Thalis said, her face shadowing, her voice laced with cold anger. "Offered as a 'gift' to a rival temple by Thoth-Amon's underlings. I learned their ways, the subtle arts of unbinding what others sought to control, especially from the acolytes of Nebthu, who took particular pleasure in his 'lessons' of domination." Her eyes glinted. "Unlike them, I do not surrender to the Lotus. I watch. I learn." A flicker of unreadable desire. "And I seek... opportunities. Xuthal holds forgotten powers. Some are best left buried. Others..." her gaze lingered on a dagger hilt at her hip. Its pommel was not of Stygian make, but something starker: a carving of a single, heavy chain link, shattered as if by an internal force. "...could remind certain Stygian priests, Nebthu foremost among them, that their manipulations have consequences. They delve into rites of binding and unbinding, seeking dominion over shadows. Perhaps I learned more than they intended, enough to turn their own arts against them. The Heart-Stone here... a shard of it could unravel many of their precious wards, turn their own bound things against them."

"Why tell us this?" Conan asked, his hand near his sword. A sudden tremor ran through the floor, and a section of the far wall shimmered, a shadowy pseudopod, thin as a whip, lashing out before retracting with a wet, sucking sound, a spark of cold, hungry light at its core. Thalis flinched, her eyes darting to the disturbance. The air grew colder, and a faint, musky odor, like that of a reptile pit mixed with ancient dust and something that pricked the nostrils like static discharge, became more pronounced.

"Perhaps," Thalis said, her voice a fraction tighter, "because this city grows more unstable by the hour. Kherm's control is not absolute, and Thog's influence spreads. Perhaps I see in you, Cimmerian, a force to stir these stagnant waters. Your strength... it could be useful." She glanced at Natala. "And your knowledge, girl, might be more valuable than you realize." She paused, then looked directly at Conan. "Kherm's tyranny, this city of living death... it reminds me too much of Stygia's own cruelties. Destroying his hold here is a worthy goal in itself. And if a tool for Nebthu's downfall falls into my hands..."

Just then, a disembodied voice, cold and resonant, echoed through the chamber, seeming to emanate from the very stones, imbued with an almost unbearable weight of sorrow, yet underscored by a chilling possessiveness. "Intruders... you disturb the dream... you disturb his sorrow... you will join the sleep, or be consumed... My Xuthal will not fall... My child must dream forever within these walls..." The voice faded, leaving an oppressive silence.

Conan's hand tightened on his sword. "Kherm?"

Thalis nodded, a grim set to her mouth. "He feels our presence. His grief is a tangible force here, amplified by the Heart-Stone. It has festered into something... more than just sorrow. He will not allow us to leave if he can prevent it."

"Out?" Natala seized the word.

"There are ways," Thalis admitted. "But the desert is cruel. And Kherm is protective of his dreamers." She looked towards an escape route she had in mind. "He will have fortified it, I am certain. His desperation makes him predictable in his defenses." Before Conan could retort, a section of the ceiling groaned, and dust showered down. Another, thicker tendril of shadow probed from a crack, its tip brushing a stone brazier, which crumbled silently to powder with an unnatural, chilling hiss. A wordless snarl, more animal than human, tore from Conan's throat as he shoved Thalis and Natala back as the tendril whipped past where they'd stood.

He hacked at the retreating tendril, which dissolved with a faint hiss and a stench like burnt circuits. Thalis stared at Conan, then at the space where the tendril had been, her breath catching for an instant before her composure returned. He fights like a force of nature, she thought, untamed, direct. Dangerous, yes, but perhaps a danger I can channel. Her dark eyes, moments before wide with alarm, now narrowed with a new calculation, weighing the barbarian's raw power against the city's encroaching madness and her own desperate need for leverage. Escaping Xuthal alone was one thing; escaping with a means to strike at Nebthu was another. This Cimmerian... he might just be the chaos factor she needed. "Very well," she said, her voice regaining its characteristic purr, though an edge of urgency now underscored it. "An alliance is mutually beneficial. There is an elixir, the 'Breath of Life,' hidden deep near the Heart-Stone that anchors Thog. It's a distillation of the Stone's purest energy, designed by the first Khermi to restore vitality and sharpen senses against the Lotus's haze for a short time. It won't make us gods, and its effects are fleeting, but it could give us an edge against Kherm's constructs and the city's oppressive influence. More importantly, it can momentarily disrupt the dream-stuff Kherm uses to animate his guardians."

"What do you want in return?" Conan cut in.

Thalis’s cool fingers lingered a heartbeat longer on Conan’s jaw, her touch a deliberate spark, her dark eyes searching his with a promise of secrets and forbidden pleasures. “Your strength, Cimmerian,” she murmured, her breath warm against his ear, “could unmake empires—or bind them to your will.” Conan’s muscles tensed, his barbarian instincts warring with the cold suspicion that her beauty was as much a trap as Xuthal’s dreaming halls. "With you... perhaps we can escape, and I can claim a prize or two for my troubles with Nebthu. That Heart-Stone is key."

Conan removed her hand. "Our only interest is leaving. Help us, you'll be rewarded. Hinder us..."

Thalis's smile turned colder. "Very well. The elixir is deep within, near Thog's lair. The guardians there are not to be trifled with. They are extensions of Kherm's will, fueled by the city's desperate energy. Their solidity varies; the closer to Kherm or a nexus of his power, the more real they become."

Natala, recalling a diagram from her father's fragmented notes—a depiction of an energy conduit linked to a central focusing crystal—pointed to a carving on the wall depicting Thog coiled around a pulsating stone. "Look\! Thog, coiled around a pulsating 'Heart-Stone'\! Lines of dark energy flow from it. Father theorized the Heart-Stone wasn't just a prison, but a power source, a conduit for Kherm's control and Thog's anchor\! He also wrote that a significant physical disruption to it could unravel Kherm's hold and potentially banish Thog."

"Lead the way," Conan said.

Thalis smiled. "Follow. And try not to get eaten."

## Chapter 4: The Slumbering God Stirs

The passage was cold, the air heavy with the scent of dust and something acrid, almost like ancient, decaying metal. Green-lumed jewels cast undulating shadows. A faint, rhythmic sighing emanated from the stones—the city itself breathing, Natala thought, or Kherm’s will woven into its fabric. Amorphous shapes of deeper blackness, almost too quick to see, flickered in the corners of their vision—each carrying that fleeting, hellish ruby spark—manifestations of Thog’s growing influence. One brushed against a loose stone, which crumbled to dust with an unnatural speed, leaving behind a crawling itch on the skin where its shadow fell. The very air seemed to vibrate with a low thrumming, and occasionally, the walls themselves would seem to shift and flow like dark water, disorienting them. Conan muttered, “By Crom, what new devilry is this?” His Cimmerian mind, grounded in the stark realities of blood and steel, recoiled from the impossible fluidity of the stone, a silent snarl forming in his throat against such sorcerous affronts to nature. Small, skittering sounds echoed from unseen crevices, like the claws of some monstrous insect. The oppressive atmosphere felt heavier here, closer to the Heart-Stone.

As a whip-like tendril of shadow lashed from a crevice, its ruby spark glinting with malice, Thalis hissed, “Down\!” The trio dropped to the cold stone, the tendril’s icy passage stirring the air above them. It retracted with a wet, sucking sound, leaving a faint stench of burnt stars. In the tense pause that followed, Thalis rose, her movements fluid despite the danger. She stepped closer to Conan, ostensibly to point out a faintly glowing glyph on the wall, its lines pulsing with the city’s unnatural rhythm. Her body pressed subtly against his broad back, the soft warmth of her bare breast brushing against his skin. For a fleeting moment, Conan savored the sensation, a primal spark of pleasure cutting through the oppressive gloom. Her voice dropped to a low, intimate murmur, barely audible over the stone’s sighing. “Stay close, barbarian. In this place, strength like yours is a beacon… and I’ve always been drawn to fire.” Her dark eyes, catching the green luminescence, held his for a heartbeat, a teasing challenge beneath their cool calculation.

Conan’s muscles tensed, his barbarian instincts warring with the cold suspicion that her touch was as much a trap as Xuthal’s shifting halls. He grunted, stepping back slightly, his gaze narrowing. “Keep your fire to yourself, Stygian. We’ve enough to burn us here.” Yet the heat of her proximity lingered, a fleeting distraction he shook off with a scowl.

Natala, crouched nearby, her fingers tracing a different glyph as she muttered about its archaic origins, seemed oblivious to the exchange. But her shoulders stiffened, a subtle sign of her scholar’s intuition catching the shift in the air. The faint pang of inadequacy from earlier stirred again, though she buried it beneath her focus, her eyes narrowing as she deciphered the glyph’s meaning.

“The elixir is in the city’s heart,” Thalis whispered, her earlier confidence tinged with caution. “A place of great power, great danger. The oldest guardians sleep there, near Thog’s central chamber. They are echoes of Kherm’s lost protectors, from his own world.”

They descended spiraling ramps, the architecture growing older, cyclopean, its angles subtly wrong, seeming to twist the eye. The air grew colder, the sighing louder, joined by a subsonic vibration that resonated in their bones. The scent of decay and ozone grew stronger. Conan felt Kherm’s attention like a physical weight, a cold pressure on his mind, now laced with a possessive anger. He fought off a fleeting image: an immense, star-faring vessel, impossibly vast, drifting silent and cold through an empty void. A profound sense of loneliness emanated from it, a sorrow tinged with the desolation of cosmic abandonment, but now twisted with a bitter resentment. He gritted his teeth, shaking his head to clear it; the sorcerer’s pain was a palpable thing, yet it fueled a dangerous madness. Another whisper, closer this time, slithered through his mind: “Why do you resist the peace of the dream? My world is dust... gone. Only Xuthal remains... my Xuthal... my dream... my little one’s only haven from the nothingness...” A spectral image of Kherm, gaunt and sorrowful, flickered at the edge of Conan’s vision, his eyes pleading, then hardening with a tyrant’s resolve. Conan spat on the stone floor. “Keep your cursed dreams to yourself, wizard\!” he snarled under his breath.

Suddenly, the floor beneath them buckled. A section of the passage ahead twisted, walls flowing like liquid stone before reforming into a labyrinthine knot. For a horrifying instant, the newly formed walls writhed with oily, Thog-like tendrils and a chorus of mocking whispers echoed, before Kherm’s will, with a palpable psychic wrench felt by all three, forced the stone back into his intended, sorrowful patterns. “A trap\!” Thalis hissed, her voice tight with alarm. “Kherm’s will reshapes the city against us\! And Thog pulls at the threads of his control\!”

Conan eyed the shifting walls. “Natala, your father studied such things. Any tricks to these shifting stones?”

Natala scanned the patterns, recalling a lecture on ‘sympathetic architecture’ tied to emotional states. “It’s Kherm’s grief... it’s not just a key, it’s the mechanism. The glyphs here,” she pointed to faint etchings that pulsed with the wall’s movement, “they speak of ‘memory’ and ‘loss.’ We need to find a sequence that represents... acceptance, or a counter-emotion. Something his grief would resist.” She frowned, tracing a complex symbol. “This one... it’s similar to a dynastic seal from a lost age my father studied, but altered... twisted by sorrow. It might relate to a specific sequence, but the meaning is... elusive.”

While Natala deciphered the shifting puzzle, Thalis stopped, her head tilted. A low growl, like splintering stone, echoed from deeper within. The walls pulsed, becoming translucent for a horrifying moment, revealing a chaotic, swirling darkness beyond, filled with a sense of immense, watching malice and the stench of something like burnt stars.

“Thog stirs,” Thalis breathed, genuine fear in her eyes. “His nightmares shake Xuthal. The guardians will be agitated. Kherm fears Thog’s full awakening; it would shatter his control, and the last vestiges of his memories. And sometimes, those nightmares seem to deliberately corrupt Kherm’s own dream-constructs, twisting his sorrowful guardians into something more grotesque for a fleeting moment, a flicker of Thog’s influence that Kherm must then fight to reclaim, his power strained against the entity he sought to master.”

Natala cried out, “I think I have it\! The pattern... from the mural of the fleeing Khermi... the star-ship effigy\! Touch the points in that sequence, but in reverse\! As if returning, not fleeing\!” Thalis, appraising Natala’s sudden insight, murmured almost to herself, yet loud enough for Natala to hear, “The little sparrow has talons after all.” A flicker of defiant pride crossed Natala’s face before she refocused on the task.

Conan and Thalis, following Natala’s desperate directions, pressed specific points on the wall. With a grinding sound, the passage reformed, opening into a vast, circular chamber. The walls were covered in writhing carvings of Thog. In the center, on an obsidian pedestal, a golden flask pulsed with warm light. Immense, resonant breathing came from beneath the floor, a sound that vibrated up through their feet.

Three tall, imposing figures guarded the pedestal, their skin like tarnished silver, eyes closed, radiating menace. Their forms were vaguely reminiscent of the robed Khermi. As Kherm’s will focused, their forms solidified, intricate patterns glowing faintly on their silver skin. One, its features contorted in a silent snarl of sorrow, twitched as it sensed their approach. Another bore a shield emblazoned with a shattered star. These were not mere Xuthalites; they felt older, imbued with a deeper despair and a more potent, sorrowful strength.

“Dream-projected guardians,” Thalis whispered. “Constructs of Kherm’s will, drawn from his deepest grief. Attack them physically, and all Xuthal will know. Thog’s attention will be absolute.”

Conan scanned the chamber. “There must be a way to disrupt them without a direct fight. Natala, those glyphs around the base? What do they say about these things?”

Natala quickly examined the etchings. “They speak of ‘focused will’ and ‘sympathetic resonance.’ They are dream-constructs, tied to Kherm’s emotions. We must distract them, disrupt the sorrow that binds them here.” She looked at Thalis. “Can you project something potent? A strong, defiant emotion?”

Thalis considered. “A dream of rebellion? Of breaking chains? Yes, that resonates. It would be draining.” One of the silver guardians seemed to shrug off Conan’s initial physical diversion—a large stone he’d dislodged—with contemptuous ease, its form barely flickering. Thalis’s initial psychic probe, a wave of defiant energy, seemed to only momentarily stagger them, emphasizing their deep connection to Kherm’s potent grief.

“Our best chance,” Natala insisted.

“Very well,” Thalis agreed. “Cimmerian, your cue. A distraction they cannot ignore.”

Conan hefted a massive, loose block of stone. “This should get their attention.” With a mighty roar, he slammed it against a load-bearing pillar. The impact was deafening. Dust rained down. Simultaneously, Conan let out a ferocious Cimmerian war cry. The breathing below paused, then resumed with an angry, guttural rumble. A wave of pure terror washed over them. The guardians’ metallic eyelids snapped open, their eyes swirling vortexes of cold light. They turned towards Conan, their movements stiff, yet imbued with a desperate strength.

One of the guardians, its face a mask of Kherm’s own anguish, raised a hand. “You will not profane this sacred place of memory\!” its voice was a chorus of grieving whispers.

“Now, Natala\! Thalis\!” Conan bellowed, drawing his saber.

Natala closed her eyes, focusing on her father’s defiance against the Stygian priests, the memory of his courage a burning coal in her heart. Thalis sank to her knees, a fierce silver aura flowing from her, enveloping the guardians in a tempestuous dream of shattered chains and defiant cries. “Awake\!” she commanded, her voice echoing with power. “Your master’s grief is not your eternity\!”

Conan sprinted, snatched the golden flask. The guardians swayed, their forms flickering. But one, the largest, bearing the shattered star shield, resisted, growling as it stepped towards Conan, its silver hand outstretched, crackling with dark energy. A rumble of profound displeasure came from below.

## Chapter 5: The Wrath of the Slithering God and the Fury of the Dream-Master

The deeper passages pulsed with malevolent energy. The city's sighing whisper had become a guttural rasp; walls shifted like disturbed water, their surfaces slick with an unseen ichor. Thog's musky, otherworldly odor choked the air, thick and cloying, now mixed with the sharp tang of ozone and something like cold, dead stars. More amorphous limbs of shadow, thicker now and always bearing that central spark of ruby malice, whipped from crevices, forcing them to dodge. Conan felt a fleeting internal curse, a raw thought: No beast of earth or hell prepared a man for such sights. One Xuthalite, seemingly asleep in a niche, suddenly lunged, its eyes burning with Thog's malevolence rather than Kherm's sorrowful control, its nails elongated into shadowy claws that dripped a viscous, black ichor. Conan barely parried the unexpected attack—the creature's touch an unholy cold that bit even through his guard—and it dissolved into oily smoke when his blade passed through it, leaving behind a chilling, disembodied laughter that seemed to echo from the Slithering God itself. The very ground felt unsteady, as if they walked on the skin of some vast, dreaming beast.

"They know," Thalis whispered, her face pale. "Kherm will be furious. His control is being challenged. And Thog... Thog is awake and playing, delighting in this chaos."

The elixir's fire still burned in Conan's veins, though he sensed its potency was finite, a temporary sharpening of his already formidable senses. Natala felt invigorated, a desperate energy thrumming through her. Even Thalis moved with a renewed, confident grace.

The passage Thalis led them through was ancient, the stone crumbling in places. Suddenly, a wall section shimmered. A Xuthalite warrior, its armor a grotesque parody of Khermi designs, eyes burning with Kherm's reflected fury, lunged, hands ending in shadowy talons. Conan met the charge. His saber passed through its arm with little resistance, yet the talons raked his chest, drawing blood that sizzled faintly where it touched his skin. The wound was shallow, the pain an icy burn that felt less of torn flesh and more of a spirit chilled to the bone, yet it was a stark reminder that even dreams could kill in this accursed place.

"More dream than substance, but still dangerous\!" Thalis cried. "Natala, those archway glyphs—their weakness?"

Natala, her mind racing, focused on the intricate symbols carved around the arch. The glyphs swam before her eyes, the pressure immense. "Anchors for their manifestations\! The central glyph, the keystone—it's a symbol of Kherm's sorrow... a stylized weeping eye\! Smash it, Conan\!"

Conan, needing no second bidding when destruction was called for, spotted the weeping eye glyph. With a grunt, he swung his sword, not with the edge, but with the flat, striking the keystone with brutal force. The glyph fractured with a sound like shattering glass. The warrior shrieked, its form flickering violently as its anchor point was destroyed, and dissolved into motes of despairing light.

Their progress became a running battle. Xuthalites materialized, their forms more solid and dangerous as Kherm's rage intensified, though none possessed the true, chilling weight of the guardians Kherm would later summon. Some wielded weapons of pure shadow that felt unnaturally cold, others attacked with the chilling touch of the void that numbed the flesh. Conan fought with savage fury, his Cimmerian blood singing with the familiar song of battle. Thalis, conserving her more potent magic, used her dagger with deadly grace, her movements precise, occasionally uttering sharp Stygian syllables that caused the dream-constructs to recoil or waver. Natala, no longer a helpless noblewoman, called out weaknesses in glyph patterns and structural instabilities, her knowledge becoming a weapon in itself. She felt a surge of fear, then a grim satisfaction as her insights proved useful, her father's dusty scrolls taking on a terrifying, practical reality. Once, she pointed out a loose keystone in an archway just as a shadowy horror began to coalesce beneath it. Conan, with a well-aimed stone, brought the arch crashing down. Natala’s frame, once softened by Brythunian courts, now moved with a lean, purposeful grace, her torn silks clinging to sweat-slicked limbs that spoke of a scholar turned warrior. Her eyes, alight with fierce determination, caught Conan’s for a fleeting moment, a spark of shared defiance that needed no words. Dispersing the threat. He caught her eye for a brief second, a flicker of grim approval in his own. The girl was learning, hardening. Good. She'd need it.

The floor bucked violently. The passage ahead collapsed in a shower of stone and dust. From the darkness beyond, a monstrous, shadowy limb, thick as a python, lashed out, obsidian shards glinting along its edges, the air around it crackling with that same ruby light seen in Thog's single eye. It slammed into the wall beside Conan, the stone cracking and groaning. The air filled with the stench of something ancient and rotten, a smell that spoke of tombs and dead stars, and a psychic pressure that made reality itself seem to warp and bend.

"Thog\!" Thalis screamed. "He bars our way\!"

Conan roared defiance. "If we cannot go around, then through\!" He hacked at the limb. It recoiled with a psychic shriek that clawed at their minds, making Natala cry out and clutch her head, but another, larger, snaked out from the rubble, its surface roiling with captured, screaming faces.

Conan found himself facing a manifestation of Thog—a vortex of shifting shadows, its single eye a swirling abyss that reflected their deepest fears before igniting with a hateful, inner fire. It was a churning horror, its form defying easy comprehension, its presence exuding a cold that was not of earth, and the very air around it shimmered as if reality was unraveling. He met its gaze, sword ready, and with a barbaric yell, buried his blade in its densest part. The entity shrieked, a sound that was both physical and mental, and recoiled, its form wavering. This thing is tied to the city, to that Heart-Stone, the tactical thought struck him with cold clarity. Break the anchor, break the beast.

After an eternity of fighting through shifting corridors and spectral foes, Thalis stopped before a blank wall. "This is it." She pressed a sequence of symbols Natala had identified from a crumbling fresco depicting Kherm's flight from his doomed world—though Natala had hesitated over one symbol, unsure if it was a star or a closing eye, before Thalis urged her to choose. Stone slid inward with a groan, revealing a narrow opening and a star-dusted sky. The passage beyond was short and tight, the air within it cold and tasting of ancient, stagnant water and stone dust, before it abruptly opened out. "An old emergency exit, leading out beyond the city's immediate influence," Thalis explained, her voice grim as she peered into the sudden space. "But be warned, Kherm will have defenses. He would not leave any escape unguarded or untainted by his despair. Given his state, he will likely be there himself."

Freedom. Or so they thought. Conan pushed through the constricted exit, finding not open desert, but a small, enclosed subterranean cistern. On the narrow ledge surrounding the dark, still water, stood a dozen Xuthalite warriors, more solid than any before, their eyes open, filled with a desperate, murderous light. At their head, Kherm himself, robed in shimmering black, his face a mask of cold fury, profound weariness, and raw obsession. His staff, topped with a multifaceted black crystal, pulsed with an unholy light. In his other hand, he clutched the small, worn star-gleam toy. His presence was a physical weight, the very air thick with a sorrow that sought to drown them, now sharpened by a palpable madness.

"Thalis," Kherm's voice was a low growl, like stones grinding together, yet edged with a chilling calm that was more terrifying than rage. "You persist in this folly. Thog is... agitated. His full awakening threatens Xuthal, the last bastion against the oblivion that consumed my world, my child, my little star-sailor\!" His voice, though controlled, trembled slightly on the last words, a flicker of the broken being beneath the tyrant. "Only a potent life-force, a new dream, can calm him now\! Perhaps your dreams will suffice\!"

His face contorted, the cold mask cracking to reveal raw agony. "You speak of waking worlds, Stygian? I saw my world burn\! My child... her laughter silenced by the void\! Xuthal is all that remains, a dream woven from my very soul, a bulwark against the endless night\! You cannot understand the necessity of this peace, this order\!"

Thalis spat, her earlier composure replaced by a cold fury that mirrored Kherm's own. "Your obsession is your prison, Kherm\! You are no better than the Stygian priests who chain gods for power, who delight in breaking spirits like yours... and mine\! This 'peace' is a living death, a monument to your failure to let go\!" This declaration seemed to solidify her resolve, her stance becoming more aggressive, her hand gripping her dagger with purpose.

Kherm sneered, his voice regaining its cold edge, his eyes glittering with a fanatic's light. "So be it. The girl," his gaze fixed on Natala, "will serve well in the deeper dream-levels. The barbarian... your vitality will sustain Thog. As for you, Thalis, an eternity of waking nightmares\!" He raised his staff, and the water in the cistern began to churn. "You will not leave\! Xuthal is eternal\! My sorrow is eternal\! And I am its master\!" From the dark water, shadowy forms began to coalesce, dream-constructs of his lost people, their eyes hollow with grief, their hands reaching.

The Xuthalite warriors advanced, their movements unnervingly precise. Conan roared, meeting their charge. Steel rang against shadowy blades and ethereal armor. Thalis fought beside him, her dagger a silver serpent darting through the fray, her lips moving in silent Stygian incantations that seemed to make the very air around her targets shimmer and distort.

Natala, her heart pounding, focused on Kherm. His staff pulsed in time with a larger, pulsating black rock set into the cistern wall behind him—the Heart-Stone, its surface veined with sickly green light, emanating a palpable thrum of dark power.

"Conan\! Thalis\!" she cried, her voice cutting through the din. "The Heart-Stone\! Behind Kherm\! That's Thog's anchor\! Conan, if you can damage it...\!"

Kherm, distracted by Natala's cry, turned to unleash a blast of shadow energy at Conan. Conan dodged, the energy scorching the stone where he'd stood.

Thalis saw her opening and lunged at Kherm. "Your sorrow is your own, Dream-Master\! Release this city\!"

Kherm parried with his staff, a magical duel erupting in crackling energies and clashing wills. He snarled, "You will not take her from me again\!" and a spectral image of a laughing child, transparent and sorrowful, flickered around him, lashing out with tendrils of pure grief that Thalis barely deflected, her own Stygian wards flaring defensively.

While Kherm was engaged, Natala saw Conan battling two Xuthalites near the Heart-Stone. "Conan, the Stone\! A direct blow might shatter its focus\!" she yelled, pointing to a fissure Conan's earlier struggles had inadvertently created near its base.

Conan, grunting with effort as he dispatched one warrior, saw his chance. The last of the elixir's fading fire burned through him. With a savage roar, he spun, his greatsword arcing. He brought the pommel of his sword down with all his Cimmerian might onto the exposed, cracked base of the Heart-Stone.

The impact resounded like a thunderclap. The Heart-Stone erupted in a blinding, chaotic flash of green and black light. Kherm shrieked, not just in pain, but as if his very soul was being torn from the fabric of Xuthal. He attempted one final, monumental exertion of will – a wave of pure despair lashing out, trying to mend the Stone or shield it with his own essence, but it was too late. The dark energy imploded from his staff, which shattered in his grip. The dream-constructs from the water dissolved with mournful sighs. Kherm was thrown backwards, convulsing. The unholy light in his staff didn't just shatter but seemed to claw its way back into him, consuming him from within. His robes billowed as if in a phantom wind, and for a moment, his form became a vortex of screaming shadows and fading starlight before collapsing. "No... my memories... my Xuthal... my little star..." he choked, his voice a desperate whisper that echoed with cosmic despair. He clawed at the air, as if trying to hold onto fading dreams, then his eyes, for a horrifying instant, lost all human focus, becoming twin windows onto a cold, star-dusted void. "...lost... forever... kssssh...thk..." The last was not a word, but a dry, clicking sound, like galaxies crumbling to dust. The fragile star-sailor fell from his grasp and skittered across the ledge, coming to rest near the violently pulsing, fractured Heart-Stone. Conan spared a glance: a child's plaything amidst the ruin of a god's dream, a fragile speck against cosmic madness. The Xuthalite warriors faltered, their forms becoming translucent, their light dimming, some collapsing into dust. The cistern shuddered. The black water boiled.

A monstrous, scaled head, larger than a crocodile's, its eye a vortex of captured, despairing souls that pulsed with a sickly internal luminescence, surged from the depths—Thog, its form shifting, a chaotic mass of shadow and scale, incorporating the screaming, dissolving faces of Xuthalites. It was less a physical creature and more a tear in the fabric of reality, its edges blurring, its roar a sound that promised madness, the very air around it distorting, colors shifting into unknown spectra. Before the full horror could settle, a momentary, raw thought flashed through Conan's mind: No beast of earth or hell prepared a man for such a sight. Then, for a vertiginous instant, he felt the sanity of the world itself fraying at the edges, the sheer impossibility of the entity threatening to overwhelm his senses more than any physical blow; a cold, cosmic dread tried to unman him, a terror far deeper than fear of fang or claw. Tendrils of pure void, cold enough to freeze the soul, lashed out, carving grooves in the stone. The air reeked of ozone, decay, and something utterly alien that scraped at the sanity.

"Crom\!" Conan yelled, shoving Natala towards the dark opening of the escape tunnel. "Go\! Now\!"

Thalis, seeing Kherm writhing on the ground, his form rapidly fading, snatched an ornate dagger Kherm had dropped. A shard of the now-violently-pulsing Heart-Stone lay beside him, glowing with unstable power; she scooped that up too, its energy raw and chaotic. "This way\! The city is tearing itself apart\!"

Thog's head lunged at Conan. He leaped, his saber scoring its snout. Thog bellowed, thrashing, its shadowy form lashing out, reality itself seeming to ripple and tear around it. Conan leaped onto its neck, driving his sword down towards where its dark heart should be. The creature's form flickered, its connection to this plane unstable due to the damaged Heart-Stone, but its rage was undiminished, its hunger now raw and uncontrolled. It tried to pull Conan into its shifting mass, its touch burning like absolute zero, visions of cosmic horror assaulting his mind. Conan felt his strength being sapped, the very essence of his being threatened by the creature's anti-life aura. He roared, driving his blade deeper, but it was like stabbing smoke and shadow.

"Its essence is tied to the void beyond the stone\!" Natala yelled from the tunnel mouth, her voice sharp with urgency despite the psychic pressure that made her sway. "Sever that tie, Thalis\! Your unbinding magic\! The Stygian rites of severance\!" As Thog's unmaking began to distort the very chamber, a jagged piece of the ceiling, loosened by the creature's thrashing, broke free, hurtling towards a momentarily vulnerable Conan. "Conan, look out\!" Natala screamed, shoving a loose, fist-sized rock from the tunnel entrance with all her might. It struck the falling debris, not enough to stop it, but deflecting it just enough to crash harmlessly beside the Cimmerian. He grunted, a rough sound of acknowledgement for the girl's quick, if desperate, thinking—another debt owed in a battle that offered no time for proper thanks.

Thalis, seeing Conan struggling against the increasingly chaotic entity, focused her will. She recalled the forbidden Stygian texts she had pored over in secret during her captivity, texts detailing the unweaving of powerful bindings, the severing of anchors to the Outer Dark—arts her captors, particularly Nebthu, had sought to master, not unmake. Channeling this dangerous knowledge, not as raw light, but as a precise unbinding, she held the unstable Heart-Stone shard aloft, its chaotic energy a dangerous amplifier. Chanting words that felt like tearing silk, Thalis’s body swayed as if in a trance, her movements a sinuous dance that seemed to pull the very shadows of Xuthal into her spell. Each Stygian syllable fell like a lover’s whisper, her midnight hair whipping around her like a living veil, the Heart-Stone shard glowing brighter in her grip as if answering her fierce, primal will. The air crackled with the forbidden energy of her craft, a display both beautiful and terrifying. Words that seemed to pull at the very fabric of existence with each syllable, she thrust her hand forward. No beam of light, but rather a lance of absolute nothingness, a ripple of pure unmaking that visibly warped the air like heat haze over a frozen landscape, shot from her fingertips. It struck the point where Thog's ethereal form seemed most anchored to the crumbling reality of Xuthal, a nexus of swirling shadow near the shattered Heart-Stone. The sound was not a shriek, but a deafening implosion, as if a vacuum had opened into another, hostile dimension.

Thog's physical form began to rapidly dissipate, not just wounded, but unmade, its substance dissolving into oily smoke and fading whispers as the Heart-Stone's instability amplified the chaotic unbinding. The very air around it warped and tore. For a horrifying moment, they glimpsed a chilling expanse of utter blackness beyond, a void teeming with unseen, ancient hunger, before reality snapped back with a concussive force. Thog's resistance was immense; the unbinding effect flickered, and Thalis cried out, blood trickling from her nose. But Conan, sensing the critical shift as Thalis's sorcery tore at the entity's core, roared and plunged his sword into the dissipating, struggling mass one last time. His Cimmerian steel, though largely useless against Thog's fully coherent alien nature, now bit into the unraveling chaos, physically disrupting the residual energies and adding a barbarian's brute finality to the delicate, sorcerous unmaking.

Conan, feeling the pressure lessen as Thog's form destabilized completely, wrenched his sword free. He spun, parried a last, desperate Xuthalite that was more shadow than substance, and kicked the fading warrior into the churning water. Then, he sprinted for the escape tunnel, diving through as the cistern roof collapsed with a deafening roar.

The passage was short. They stumbled out onto cool desert sands. Behind them, Xuthal crumbled, its death throes and Thog's fading bellows muffled by the collapsing stone. A vast cloud of greenish dust, shot through with flickers of unholy light, rose into the sky, obscuring the stars.

## Epilogue: The Taste of Dawn

They ran until Xuthal was a distant, rising dust plume against the bruised pre-dawn sky. Conan finally slowed, chest heaving, leaning on his sword. The Stygian clutched Kherm's jewel-encrusted dagger, and the faintly glowing, still-warm fragment of the Heart-Stone.

"Crom\! Too close," Conan admitted, wiping sweat and grime from his brow. He thought of Kherm—not a monster, but a being broken by a loss so vast it had shattered his mind and turned his grief into a prison for countless souls. The alien sorrow he'd brushed against, the echoes of a child's laughter amidst dying stars, the final, inhuman click from the Dream-Master—it left a bitter taste, a grim understanding of how even profound love could curdle into possessive madness. He looked at Natala, who stood watching the dust cloud, her expression a mixture of exhaustion and a newfound, hard-won strength. The silence from the ruins was profound now, deeper than any desert stillness.

Natala shivered, though not from cold. "All those dreamers," she whispered, "trapped so long. Now... either peace or nothingness. At least their sorrow ends." She turned from the ruin, her gaze resolute. "Xuthal… it showed me that knowledge isn't just for scrolls and quiet libraries. It's a weapon, a shield. My father taught me much, but this city taught me how to wield it." A quiet determination settled in her eyes. The horrors had not broken her, but forged her anew. "I won't forget what I learned here. Or what we fought for."

Conan grunted, a sound of grim acknowledgment. "You fought well, girl. You have steel in you."

Thalis leaned against a rock, her breathing evening out. "Indeed. Xuthal does not yield its prisoners easily." She tested the dagger's edge with a bloodied thumb. "Kherm had quality. And the Heart-Stone fragment," she held it up, its light pulsing erratically, "it still pulses. A dangerous tool, but potent. It resonates with an ancient power, something the oldest Stygian texts only hint at as the 'Tears of Forgotten Gods,' a power that could unravel the bindings of Set himself if wielded with enough will and blood." She looked out at the vast desert. "The oasis is a day's march, perhaps less if we push."

"And then?" Conan asked, sheathing his sword.

Thalis met his look, her dark eyes holding a new, sharper light. "Then, Cimmerian, the world awaits. Stygia, in particular. My former masters, like Nebthu, thought to bury me, to break my spirit with their bindings and lotus dreams. With this dagger, and this Heart-Stone shard, I hold a key to unravelling their power." She smiled, a dangerous, predatory curve of her lips. "They practice the Rites of Set, seeking to bind shadows to their will. This dagger can sever such bonds, and the stone can amplify the chaos of their unmaking. Their temples, built on secrets and suffering, will tremble. They will learn what true power, and true loss, feels like. Nebthu will learn that some spirits, once awakened, cannot be caged again." A predatory gleam entered her eyes, but beneath it, Conan sensed a deep, burning pain, a resolve forged in suffering and a thirst for righteous vengeance. "Perhaps our paths will cross again, Conan. When the sands shift, and the stars align."

She pushed off the rock. "But for now, let us put distance between ourselves and that city of broken dreams. The dawn air tastes clean."

Conan nodded, his gaze lingering on the fading dust plume of Xuthal’s ruins. He offered his arm, and Natala took it, her grip firm, her fingers brushing the corded muscle of his forearm. For a moment, their eyes met—hers fierce with newfound steel, his glinting with a rare, quiet respect. The desert wind stirred her hair, and Conan caught the faint curve of her lips, no longer the soft noblewoman’s but a warrior’s, tempered by Xuthal’s fires. A spark of something unspoken passed between them, quickly buried as they turned toward the dawn. But the warmth of her touch lingered on his skin, a promise of battles yet to share. Thalis, clutching Kherm’s dagger and the pulsing Heart-Stone shard, walked beside them, her dark eyes fixed on the horizon. Together, the three unlikely allies turned their backs on Xuthal’s ruins, striding into the vast, waiting silence toward the nascent, blood-red promise of dawn. The desert wind, cool and fresh, felt like a benediction, carrying away the last whispers of Xuthal’s sorrow. Ahead lay the unknown, and for Conan, that was always where the next adventure began.

The End.
