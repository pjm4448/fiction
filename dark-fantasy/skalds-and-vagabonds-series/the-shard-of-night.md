# The Shard of Night

**Summary**

In the frozen city of Grimstrand, Veyra, a betrayed assassin, craves annihilation for her enemies. Her only hope lies in the Shard of Night, a legendary artifact of cosmic cold, locked within the accursed Temple of Zorathys.

To seize it, she must navigate a web of betrayal, facing a fanatical High Priest, ambitious acolytes, and icy horrors. But the Shard's power comes at a soul-shattering cost, twisting reality and drawing the attention of an ancient cult.

## Chapter 1: The Pact in the Shadows

The air in the 'Frozen Hearth' tavern was a foul stew, thick enough to choke a starving snow-cat: a reeking miasma of spilled ale, the rank sweat of unwashed bodies, and the bitter, acrid smoke of peat fires that clawed at the throat like phantom talons. Outside, the wind howled like a thing of primal hunger, a ravenous wolf of the northern wastes that rattled the stout shutters of Grimstrand's dens of ill repute with skeletal fists. But within this reeking chamber, a hush had fallen, heavy and suffocating as a burial shroud. All eyes, save for those of sots too deep in their cups to see aught but the swimming phantoms in their ale, were fixed upon the ancient skald. He was a hunched, time-ravaged figure by the sputtering glow of the central fire pit, his beard a silvered, matted cascade of hoarfrost and forgotten winters, brushing his bony knees as he leaned his gaunt frame forward like some primordial carrion bird hunched over its prey. His voice, when it came, was a low, gravelly rumble, like distant thunder rolling in from the jagged, ice-fanged peaks that clawed at the bruised belly of the sky above the fortress-city.

"Aye," he rasped, his gaze like chips of obsidian sweeping the shadowed, hard-bitten faces before him, "you speak of reavers' raids and the clangor of steel on steel; wolf's work and warrior's play, mere bloody threads in the vast, dark tapestry of this world's woes. But I speak of a shadow that crept into this very Grimstrand, a tale of ice and blood whispered on the fangs of the biting winds, a legend of vengeance and sorcerous power that could freeze the very marrow in a man's bones and turn his heart to stone. I speak of Veyra… Veyra, the Shard-Wielder!" A collective tremor, born not of the drafts that snaked through the ill-fitting door but of a deeper, more primal dread, rippled through the listeners like a wave across dark water. The old skald's eyes, though filmed with the milk of extreme age, held a glint of something ancient and terrible, a hint of both savage awe and a deep, soul-shuddering fear that made strong men shift uneasily on their benches. "Her fury," he continued, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper that slithered through the gloom like a serpent through long grass, "was a winter storm given flesh, a she-devil of the ice, and her path… her path was paved with the frozen hearts of her enemies, a road of utter annihilation!"

The reek of frozen offal, of human waste and black despair: this was the true, gut-turning scent of Grimstrand, the perfume of damnation. Veyra moved through its frost-choked, labyrinthine alleys like a hunting panther, her lithe, hard-muscled form cloaked in scavenged furs that did little to ward off the biting cold, her face a mask of glacial resolve, beautiful in its savage intensity and terrible in its inhuman focus. Disgraced, betrayed by the very assassin's guild that had been her brutal, twisted family, her true kin butchered or scattered to the merciless winds, a primal, white-hot fury burned in her belly like a living coal that no cold could quench. She didn't just seek revenge, that common coin of wronged men; she craved annihilation, a cleansing fire to burn her enemies from the face of the earth and salt the ashes of their memory.

Her hope, a sliver of obsidian shard in the vast, white wilderness of her despair, lay hidden within the most sacred, most heavily guarded edifice in all of Grimstrand: the accursed Temple of Zorathys, the Frost-Queen, whose worship was a thing of ice and blood and screaming sacrifice. And within that temple, nestled in its holiest, most unhallowed sanctum like a viper in its den, lay the Shard of Night. Legend, whispered in hushed, fearful tones by those who dared speak of such things, called it a fragment of a fallen star, a tear from the black heart of the void, imbued with the very essence of cosmic cold and ancient, unknowable power that predated the gods themselves. Old, forgotten tales, grim and blood-soaked as the sagas of old Atlantis, hinted that its deepest enchantments exacted a terrible, soul-shattering price from any mortal fool enough to wield it. Veyra, driven by a vengeance that was a living thing within her, gnawing at her vitals like a cancer, considered such costs a trifle, a small price for the annihilation she craved.

In the weeks of her grim reconnaissance, patient as a spider weaving its web, Veyra had learned much of the High Priest Ghorthus. His devotion to the Frost-Queen Zorathys was a chilling, slavering mania that bordered on the inhuman, a fanaticism that blazed in his eyes like cold fire. His sermons, delivered in a voice like the grinding of glaciers, spoke of the Frost-Queen's glorious, unyielding cold, of the purity of absolute zero, of the cleansing death that awaited all who defied her icy embrace. Ironically, Ghorthus's own lesser kin, a family of grasping, small-souled merchants, had been decimated years ago by the 'Silent Hand', the very guild of cutthroats Veyra now hunted with a wolf's patience. This dark knowledge fueled her grim, unswerving purpose like oil poured on flame. Ghorthus, in his public rites, often clutched a small, yellowed finger bone (a relic of some forgotten saint or demon), a ritual tic, a nervous habit that punctuated his pronouncements of icy doom. His paranoia about the 'Silent Hand' was a festering, suppurating wound in his black soul, one Veyra, with the cold calculation of her deadly trade, noted well and filed away for future use. He would be an unwitting, screaming pawn in her bloody game.

But Veyra, for all her skill and savage courage, could not breach Zorathys's ice-bound sanctum alone. She needed Lirath, a gaunt, shadow-eyed Hyperborean herbalist, whose knowledge of esoteric, mind-bending flora was whispered to be unparalleled in the northern lands. Exiled years prior (some said for communing with spirits of the earth deemed unclean by Zorathys's puritanical, black-robed clergy, others for a bitter, venomous dispute with a temple elder over a rare, potent herb she'd cultivated, which the elder then claimed as his own discovery, leading to her disgrace and banishment), she had been grudgingly recalled for the upcoming Feast of the Frost Moon, a night of blood and sacrifice when the temple's defenses would be focused inward.

Veyra found her in a cramped, frost-rimed hovel that stank of bitter herbs and despair, the dwelling of the damned. "I require your skills, Lirath of Hyperborea," Veyra stated, her voice devoid of warmth, laying a pouch heavy with ill-gotten silver upon the crude wooden table with a dull, metallic thud. "A generous share of the spoils will be yours, if you've the guts for the work."

Lirath's pale, lashless eyes, like chips of dirty ice in a cadaverous face, flickered towards the silver, then to Veyra's hard face, reading the promise of death there. "Spoils from what, she-wolf of the shadows?" she rasped, her voice thin and dry as autumn leaves crushed underfoot.

Veyra's smile was a fleeting, grim slash in the gloom, predatory and cold. "From the cleansing of a great stain from the face of this city. I intend to pay a visit to the Temple of Zorathys. And when I leave, I will carry with me the Shard of Night."

A strange, unholy gleam ignited in Lirath's eyes: raw, naked covetousness, swiftly masked by a veneer of fear like a curtain drawn across a window. "The Shard…" she breathed, the words a mere exhalation of frost in the frigid air, heavy with desire and dread. Then, a tremor, a visible shiver, shook her gaunt frame like a leaf in the wind. "My exile… it was unjust, Veyra. They stole my work, my standing, then cast me out to the ice wolves and the howling winds for their own petty, grasping jealousies. The wilderness, woman, teaches you a desperation that gnaws at your soul like a starving rat." Her voice held a bitter, venomous undertone, the poison of years of resentment. "Zorathys's wrath is not to be trifled with," Lirath murmured then, a genuine, bone-deep shiver touching her before her pragmatic, avaricious mask settled once more like snow covering filth.

"Your fear is your own demon to wrestle. Will you craft what I need, or will you die poor in this frozen sty?" Veyra pressed, her voice like the scrape of steel on stone, already sensing the depth of Lirath's festering resentment, a poisoned lever she could use to pry open the gates of betrayal.

Lirath hesitated, her thin lips working like a fish gasping on dry land. "The incense… the bulky black lotus, for disorientation that maddens and confuses? And the pale frostbloom, to dull the senses to a brute stupor? And something… more, something to seal the bargain with death?"

"Cave-viper venom," Veyra confirmed, her voice flat as a tombstone. "Undetectable, lethal as a sorcerer's curse."

Lirath nodded slowly, her eyes glittering with unholy light. "It can be done." She glanced at the silver, then met Veyra's unwavering gaze with something like desperate hunger. "Your offer is… compelling. And the Shard itself… a prize beyond the dreams of misers, beyond mere silver and gold." The unholy, desperate alliance was struck in the flickering gloom of the hovel, sealed with greed and sealed in blood yet to be spilled.

While Lirath, with furtive, skilled hands, toiled over her noxious concoctions in the shadows, Veyra meticulously prepared for the bloody work ahead with the focus of a master craftsman. She crafted a cunning replica of the Shard from stolen, cleverly cut glass, oiled the tiny, deadly mechanism of her poison ring until it moved smooth as silk, and ensured her Cimmerian steel hairpin, honed to a razor point for picking locks, was secure in the dark coils of her hair. Her plan was brutal in its simplicity: infiltrate the temple during the evening rites, taint the braziers in the inner sanctum with Lirath's mind-stealing, death-dealing brew. She knew of the temple's stringent, probing searches and its grimly efficient corpse disposal; any who fell, friend or foe, within Zorathys's accursed precincts were swiftly, unceremoniously committed to the temple's reeking charnel pit, a maw of frozen death beneath the unhallowed stones. She counted on that brutal, uncaring efficiency to hide her tracks.

## Chapter 2: Infiltration and Seeds of Doubt

The night before the Feast of the Frost Moon, a night of ill omen and biting cold that promised only blood and horror, Veyra found a rare moment of black stillness. A memory, sharp as a shard of new ice, surfaced unbidden from the depths: Anya, her sister, her laughter like the chiming of tiny silver bells in a summer wind that now seemed a lifetime ago. Then the memory twisted, as memories are wont to do in a mind bent on vengeance, the laughter dissolving into a choked, blood-flecked gasp, the pure white snow of their homeland stained with a hideous, spreading crimson that steamed in the cold air. *This is why,* she thought, the fury coiling in her gut like a frozen serpent, solidifying into a core of icy resolve harder than steel. *For the laughter they stole, for the blood they spilled, for the life they murdered.*

The thrum of barbaric, hide-skinned drums and the mournful, ululating wail of bone flutes vibrated through Veyra's bare, calloused feet like the pulse of some monstrous, alien heart. She was a ghost among the herd of shivering slave-dancers, procured like cattle for the bloody Feast, nameless meat for the Frost-Queen's entertainment. Her eyes, like those of a cornered wolf, constantly scanned her surroundings with predatory vigilance, returning again and again to Lirath. The Hyperborean herbalist moved with a strange, conflicting energy: at times fawningly helpful, her thin lips stretched in a sycophantic smile that never reached her dead eyes; at others, evasive and furtive, her gaze darting away like a startled lizard whenever Veyra tried to catch it. A worm of unease gnawed at Veyra's gut.

Adding to the disquiet was Ysmir, a young acolyte of the temple, his handsome, boyish face a mask of zealous, almost inhuman fervor that burned like cold fire. During the frenetic preparations, Veyra observed him near the temple storerooms, his movements precise and almost reverent as he meticulously arranged bundles of rare, exotic incense meant for Ghorthus's private, unspeakable meditations. He paused, bowing low with a disturbing humility as a senior, fat-jowled priest passed, his ambition a palpable, suffocating aura that clung to him like a stench. Later, with a ritual stylus of carved bone, he etched tiny, intricate ice runes into the flesh of his forearm, his expression serene, almost ecstatic, as dark blood welled and froze instantly in the unnatural chill of the temple. Once, his burning, ice-blue eyes, devoid of any human warmth, fixed on Veyra like a predator marking prey. "Only the pure of heart and soul may endure Zorathys's divine gaze," he whispered, his breath misting in the frigid air like the exhalation of a corpse. "The tainted… they shall be cleansed in ice, their impurities burned away by the sacred frost." His words, though soft, felt like a pointed, poisoned barb aimed directly at her heart.

Veyra's unease solidified into a cold knot of certainty, hard as iron. She saw Ysmir corner Lirath near a shadowed storeroom, his movements predatory. His voice was a low, menacing hiss, but his posture was that of an inquisitor, accusatory and threatening, his body blocking her escape. Lirath appeared flustered, her hands twisting a crude bone amulet at her throat, her face pale and drawn as a corpse's. Ysmir seemed to press her, his words like hammer blows, about unusual herbs, perhaps about Veyra herself, the outsider in their midst, the viper in the nest.

Later, Veyra's keen eyes spotted a crumpled piece of parchment near the very spot where Ysmir had confronted the herbalist, half-hidden in shadow. The script was hurried, spidery: "The Hyperborean witch suspects an outsider, a defiler. The High Priest's promised reward is only for the one who delivers the true threat to the sanctity of the Shard into his hands." Ysmir's mark, a stylized rune of ice and blood, was scrawled at the bottom. He was playing his own treacherous, ambitious game, seeking to rise through betrayal.

A wave of black uncertainty washed over Veyra like cold water. Was Lirath merely a terrified, desperate pawn in this deadly game? Or was the fanatical Ysmir the primary, most dangerous threat? The Shard's dark, insidious influence, she sensed, seemed to warp perception, to twist reality into nightmare shapes that crawled at the edges of vision. The face of a passing slave-dancer momentarily contorted, in Veyra's eyes, into the leering, cruel sneer of Gorgon, the guild master whose throat she yearned to slit and whose blood she longed to drink. Veyra flinched, her hand instinctively going to the hilt of a knife that wasn't there, her fingers closing on empty air. The illusion shattered, leaving her shaken and cold with dread. The Shard's rumored psychic disturbances, its power to prey on the mind and devour sanity, were taking root in her own soul like a cancer.

Her carefully laid plan to pre-plant the drugged incense was thwarted by cruel fate. An unexpected, sudden change in the temple guard patterns (Ysmir's meddling, she suspected, the young viper's poison working already) blocked her intended path. The shadowed alcove where she had meant to stash the incense was now occupied by two hulking, iron-thewed temple guards, their eyes as cold and dead as the ice walls. A desperate, dangerous pivot was necessary: she would have to target High Priest Ghorthus's personal brazier, in the very heart of the sanctum, during the height of the ritual, when all eyes would be upon the sacrifice.

The bulky incense packets, heavy with their deadly freight, were hard to conceal on her sparsely clad dancer's form, her body exposed for the eyes of the temple. Luck, or perhaps some grim god of assassins, provided an unexpected opening: a discarded dancer's top of layered, dark blue linen, clearly intended for a woman of more generous, fleshy proportions than Veyra's own spare, whipcord-lean, athletic frame. The garment hung loosely on her, the bodice offering more than ample, shadowed room where her own small, firm breasts offered none. With the swift, silent grace of a jungle cat, Veyra snatched it from a pile of discarded costumes, tucking the bulky packets deep into the voluminous folds of fabric across her chest, securing them cunningly within its seams with practiced fingers. As she adjusted the ill-fitting top, a few dark, potent grains of the black lotus spilled onto the icy stone floor like seeds of death. She ground them under her bare heel, a tiny, almost contemptuous offering to the blind god of chance who laughed at mortal plans.

## Chapter 3: The Feast of Frozen Hearts and Sudden Betrayal

The Great Hall of Zorathys's temple was a vast, cyclopean cavern of living ice and brooding shadow, its immense, soul-crushing dimensions designed to awe and intimidate the hearts of mortal men and remind them of their insignificance. Torches, their flames burning with an unnatural, corpse-blue tinge that gave no warmth, cast a flickering, spectral light upon walls carved from the heart of ancient glaciers, embedded with the frozen, time-blackened relics of forgotten, monstrous beasts and the skeletal remains of fallen, long-dead heroes whose names were lost to time. At the far end of the hall, upon a great dais of polished black ice that seemed to drink the very light from the air, stood High Priest Ghorthus, a figure of gaunt, terrible majesty, a living monument to fanaticism. His eyes, burning with a fanatic's unholy zeal, scanned the assembled congregation: a sea of grim, expectant faces. Grim-faced, scar-ridden warlords, their heavy furs and boiled leathers stark and barbaric against the icy, glittering backdrop, occupied crude benches of honor near the dais, their expressions a savage mixture of feigned piety, raw ambition, and barely concealed, murderous suspicion of their rivals who sat too close. Behind them, packed shoulder to shoulder like cattle in a pen, ranks of lesser, fawning nobles, wealthy, fat-bellied merchants, and black-robed temple functionaries filled the echoing hall, their hushed, fearful anticipation a palpable, suffocating force in the frigid, deathly still air. Ghorthus, his face a mask of inhuman ecstasy, clutched the yellowed, ancient finger bone (his ritual focus), preparing to address the faithful with words of icy doom and promised suffering.

"Zorathys hungers!" Ghorthus's voice, amplified by the strange acoustics of the ice cavern, rose to a chilling, ecstatic shriek, echoing off the glittering ice walls, each word sharp as a shard of obsidian driven into flesh. "She yearns for the pure, the untainted! Her divine embrace is eternal, unyielding frost!" He raised the relic high, his eyes rolling back in their sockets until only the whites showed. Temple attendants, their faces impassive, brutalized masks devoid of mercy or humanity, dragged a young, terrified slave dancer forward like a sacrificial lamb. Stark, naked terror had frozen her scream in her throat before it could escape her bloodless lips, her voice strangled by fear. They bound her, with cruel efficiency, to the black ice altar, her pathetic, bird-like struggles pitifully small in the immense, uncaring hall that swallowed her suffering. Ghorthus began a guttural, almost bestial chant, ancient, forgotten words of power that seemed to draw the very cold from the temple stones, to summon the icy breath of the Frost-Queen herself from whatever dark dimension she inhabited. Frost, delicate and deadly as a serpent's kiss, began to creep across the dancer's exposed, quivering skin. Deep within the temple's frozen heart, unseen yet intensely, sickeningly felt by Veyra, the Shard of Night seemed to pulse with a cold, malevolent light, an answer to the priest's dark summons, a cosmic heartbeat of evil.

The barbaric ritual neared its bloody crescendo, the moment of death. Veyra, hidden like a viper amongst the other dancers, tensed, every muscle in her lithe body coiled tight as a steel spring ready to release. Ysmir, the young acolyte, his handsome face alight with a disturbing, almost sexual ecstasy as the sacrificed dancer's struggles ceased and her life force ebbed away into the frozen air like smoke, made his treacherous move. It was subtle, a slight, almost imperceptible shift of his slender body, a fractional turn of his head, his gaze locking onto a nearby, heavily armed Temple Captain with the intensity of a predator signaling its pack. Then, with deliberate, pointed intensity, his ice-blue eyes flicked directly towards Veyra, a silent, damning accusation more deadly than any blade.

Lirath, positioned closer to the dais, her face a mask of terror that cracked like thin ice, saw it too. Her carefully constructed composure, her veneer of greedy pragmatism, shattered like thin ice under a hammer blow, all pretense stripped away. Raw, animal fear contorted her gaunt features as the terrible realization struck her with the force of a physical blow: Ysmir, the young serpent, was about to betray *both* of them to the temple's merciless justice, to buy his advancement with their blood. In that frozen, heart-stopping moment, driven by her festering, years-old resentment of the temple that had wronged and exiled her, and by a sudden, fierce, desperate desire to possess the Shard herself should Veyra fail or fall, Lirath made her desperate, damning choice. Her bony hand, like the claw of a starving bird, shot out, a trembling finger pointing accusingly at Veyra like the finger of doom itself. "There! The assassin! The defiler! She befouls this holy place! She seeks the Shard of Night!"

Exposure. A snarl, more animal than human, ripped from Veyra's throat like the cry of a wounded wolf. All thought of subtlety, of cunning, vanished in a red wave of primal fury that consumed all reason. She launched herself, a streak of coiled muscle and deadly intent, towards Ghorthus's dais and the ornate, smoking brazier that was her target, her only chance. A bitter, searing memory, unbidden and unwelcome, flashed through her mind like lightning: Anya, her beloved sister, helpless, her eyes wide with a terror that mirrored the sacrificed dancer's, as the guild assassin's blood-stained blade silenced her laughter, her life, forever in one brutal instant.

Her hand, clawed like a hawk's talon seeking prey, tore at the ill-fitting dancer's top she wore. The cheap, flimsy fabric ripped with a harsh, tearing sound that echoed in her ears, and the concealed incense packets, her tools of death and chaos, tumbled free, scattering like black seeds across the polished, icy floor. A wave of burning, unexpected humiliation washed over her as the torn garment fell away, baring her torso to the cold air and the colder eyes of the assembly. Her small, firm breasts, like the spare, wind-scoured ridges of a frostbitten steppe, were unyielding, almost boyish, yet starkly, defiantly unadorned. Two dark, puckered nipples stood proudly erect on each small, pert mound, nipples that had known no lover's touch, only the kiss of cold steel and colder winds. But survival instinct, the cold, hard core of the trained assassin, and the white-hot, all-consuming fury of her vengeance overrode any fleeting shame or modesty. With a defiant, savage cry that cut through the sudden, shocked uproar of the hall like a blade through flesh, Veyra snatched the largest of the fallen packets from the ice. Ignoring the surging, shouting guards and the screams of alarm that rose like a tide, she hurled it with all the strength of her wiry, powerful arm into Ghorthus's sacred, smoking brazier.

## Chapter 4: Pandemonium and the Assassin's Gambit

The black lotus and the pale frostbloom, their innocent appearance belying the cave-viper venom with which they were laced, ignited with an unnatural, sickeningly violet flame that seemed to burn with hellfire. Billowing, acrid smoke, thick and choking as the fumes of the underworld, instantly engulfed the High Priest Ghorthus. His eyes, wide and staring, bulged from their sockets in drug-fueled, gibbering terror, his sanity fleeing like rats from a burning ship.

"Daemons!" he shrieked, his voice a cracked, inhuman screech that echoed through the chaos. "Foul sorcery from the blackest pits of the Night Below is unleashed upon us!" His long-simmering, paranoid hatred for the 'Silent Hand' assassins twisted his drug-crazed accusations into a torrent of madness and venom. "It is Borin of the Snow-Tiger clan! He conspires with Khitan shadow-weavers and their unspeakable gods! And you, Lord Faelan," he screeched, pointing a trembling, accusatory finger at another grim-faced warlord, "your coffers overflow with Stygian gold, payment for this black sacrilege!"

His wild, venomous words were like sparks thrown into a powder keg, igniting ancient hatreds. Borin of the Snow-Tiger, a hulking, bear-like warrior whose kin had clashed brutally and often with Veyra's former guild, let out a bloodcurdling roar that echoed through the chaos like thunder, "For the fallen of the Red Snow Pass, who died by assassin's steel!" He drew a massive, double-bladed axe from his belt, its polished edges gleaming wickedly in the violet haze like the eyes of a demon, and charged with the fury of a maddened bull towards Lord Jorund, a rival chieftain long suspected of colluding with the Silent Hand's cutthroats.

The sanctum erupted into a bloody, screaming pandemonium, hell unleashed on earth. Warlords, their faces contorted with hate and fear, turned on each other like starving wolves in winter. Ancient, blood-soaked grudges, long simmering beneath a thin veneer of temple piety, exploded into open, savage violence that painted the ice red. The temple guard, a hulking brute lunging for Veyra with a spiked mace raised high, grunted in agony as Borin's wild backswing caught him across the ribs, shattering bone and flesh with a sickening crunch. Borin, his face a mask of battle-lust, stormed past Veyra, barely sparing her a glance, his mind consumed by bloodlust. "One less guild snake to poison the world today, eh, wench?" he grunted, his teeth bared in a rictus grin of savage joy, before plunging back into the swirling, screaming melee, his axe rising and falling like a butcher's cleaver through meat.

Veyra, moving with the deadly grace of a striking serpent, ripped off the remnants of the torn dancer's top, thrusting the despised garment into a smoldering, lesser brazier where it caught and burned. She needed to cover her nakedness, but Lirath, the treacherous Hyperborean witch, was the immediate, more pressing threat that demanded blood. She reached the herbalist just as Lirath, her face a mask of terror, turned to flee into the screaming chaos, seeking escape. "You chose poorly, witch," Veyra hissed, her voice a venomous whisper colder than the grave. The poison ring, a tiny, almost invisible needle of death, pricked Lirath's exposed, scrawny neck with surgical precision. Lirath gasped, a small, bird-like sound, her eyes widening in sudden, horrified understanding of her fate, then sighed, a long, shuddering exhalation like wind through dead reeds, and slumped to the icy floor, another forgotten casualty in a world that had no pity for the weak or the foolish.

Veyra whirled, her eyes fixed on the black ice altar with single-minded focus. The true Shard of Night, nestled in its bed of frozen silk, pulsed with a cold, unholy radiance, its light seeming to throb in time with some cosmic, evil heartbeat that resonated in her bones. The temperature in the sanctum plummeted, the very air crackling with an unnatural, bone-chilling cold that burned the lungs. Before the altar, a frost-wraith materialized from the frigid, swirling air, a being of pure, malevolent ice summoned by the Shard's dark power. It was vaguely humanoid in shape, but crafted from a whirlwind of razor-sharp ice crystals, its eyes burning with a cold, dead-blue light that promised only oblivion and the frozen embrace of death.

The frost-wraith, a creature born of nightmare and frozen despair, lunged with terrifying speed, inhuman and implacable. Veyra, her senses honed by years of deadly peril, ducked beneath a sweeping, crystalline claw that would have torn her head from her shoulders and sent it bouncing across the ice. Her eyes darted about, seeking a weapon, an advantage, anything to survive. Seeing a heavy, toppled bronze statue of some forgotten god lying nearby, Veyra feinted to the left, then darted with lightning speed to the right. The wraith, its intelligence rudimentary but its malice profound, followed her feint like a mindless beast. With a desperate, grunting heave, Veyra shoved the heavy statue with all her might, muscles straining. It crashed with a deafening clang into a nearby burning brazier, sending a shower of molten metal and fiery embers flying through the air like a rain of stars. The frost-wraith shrieked (a sound like glaciers grinding together, a sound that set Veyra's teeth on edge and made her bones ache) as the searing flame and molten bronze met its frigid, ethereal form. It dissolved with a final, agonized hiss into a cloud of rapidly dissipating steam, banished back to whatever hell spawned it.

Panting, her lungs burning in the freezing air, Veyra sprang onto the black ice altar, her bare feet skidding on its slick surface like a dancer on death's stage. She seized the Shard of Night with both hands. Its touch was an agony of pure, unadulterated cold, a soul-deep chill that seemed to leech her very vitality, her life force, from her body like a vampire's kiss. A wave of black, hopeless despair surged through her, a psychic assault from the alien artifact that sought to drown her in darkness. She fought it, her rage, her burning need for vengeance, a fragile, flickering shield against the Shard's overwhelming power that threatened to consume her utterly. Her wild eyes landed on the still, frozen form of the sacrificed dancer, pale and lifeless. With brutal, desperate haste, Veyra dragged the corpse aside with hands that trembled. Using a fallen ceremonial dagger, its edge surprisingly keen and thirsty for blood, she began to carve a cavity into the dancer's frozen, unresisting chest. As she worked, her hands slick with half-frozen blood that steamed in the cold air, the corpse's face, in a trick of the flickering, unnatural light, seemed to flicker, to morph into Anya's, her sister's eyes wide with frozen, silent accusation that pierced her heart. A pang of guilt, sharp and unexpected as a knife between the ribs, pierced Veyra's icy resolve, followed instantly by a wave of revulsion at her own ghoulish task, at what she had become.

"For them," she snarled, the words a guttural rasp in her throat, banishing the phantom image with savage will. She plunged the true Shard of Night deep into the bloody, ice-rimmed cavity she had carved with brutal efficiency. The wound, and the Shard within, froze instantly, sealing it tight as a tomb. Then, Veyra retrieved her worthless glass replica from where it had fallen among the carnage, pressing it into Lirath's cooling, stiffening hand like a final, mocking gift. Let them find the traitorous witch with the prize, let them believe the threat was ended and the Shard recovered.

## Chapter 5: Lockdown and the Path to the Pit

Violet, venomous smoke, thick as a Stygian fog, mingled with the hot, coppery stench of spilled blood as the surviving, hard-bitten temple guards, their faces grim masks splattered with gore, brutally restored a semblance of order in the desecrated sanctum. Two guards, their chainmail rent and stained with the rust-red of arterial spray, found Lirath's sprawled corpse, the glittering glass replica clutched tightly in her dead, claw-like hand. "The Shard!" one exclaimed, his voice rough with awe and naked greed. Ysmir, the young acolyte, ever quick to avoid the taint of implication like a serpent shedding its skin, his handsome face a mask of feigned horror and righteous indignation, pointed a trembling finger with theatrical precision. "I warned of her suspicious nature, her furtive ways!" he declared to the nearby Temple Captain, his voice ringing with false piety and practiced sincerity, solidifying Lirath's role as the sole culprit, the convenient scapegoat for all their failures.

Veyra, her face an expressionless, neutral mask that revealed nothing of the savage triumph burning in her breast, watched from the shadows where she had melted like morning frost. The focus of the guards, of the priests, was on the prize, the supposed Shard lying cold and lifeless in a dead woman's grip. A lone, surviving slave-dancer, apparently cowering in abject fear, drew little attention in the bloody aftermath, merely another piece of frightened chattel. A cursory, contemptuous glance from a passing guard, a gruff, dismissive order to be gone from this place of death, and Veyra, with a display of feigned terror that would have done a veteran mummer proud, passed their brutal scrutiny unscathed.

Now began the temple's grim, well-practiced routine: the collection of the dead, the harvest of carrion. Acolytes, their faces pale and set as carved bone, dragged corpses, friend and foe alike, towards designated collection points, their movements efficient and impersonal as butchers at their bloody trade. Veyra, feigning shock and disorientation, moved with shuffling steps towards the rear of the Great Hall, towards the shadowed passages she knew led down, ever downward, to the temple's charnel pit. She found a narrow, dark service corridor hidden behind a heavy, moth-eaten tapestry depicting some forgotten, bloody battle of ancient days. The sounds of the Great Hall (the shouts of command, the groans of the wounded, the lamentations of the priests) faded behind her, swallowed by the oppressive silence of the hidden ways, the forgotten arteries of this house of death.

An iron gate, its bars thick as a man's wrist, rusted and grimly locked, blocked her path like the jaws of some primordial beast. Veyra retrieved her Cimmerian steel hairpin lockpick from its hiding place in the dark coils of her blood-matted hair. Footsteps, heavy and measured, approached from the other side: a patrol, their armor clanking in the narrow passage. Her heart hammered against her ribs like a trapped bird desperate for freedom. Her slender, skilled fingers, steady despite the tremor of adrenaline that sang in her veins, worked with desperate speed in the gloom. *Click.* The final tumbler fell with a faint, metallic sigh of surrender. She pulled the hairpin free, eased the massive gate open just enough to slip her lithe body through like smoke through a keyhole, and then pulled it silently shut as the flickering orange light of torches illuminated the corridor she had just vacated. The guards passed without a second glance, their minds on other, more pressing matters, their boots echoing away into silence.

Later, much later, when the evening had deepened into full night, the glass replica was brought before High Priest Ghorthus in his private, ice-walled chambers of meditation and dark ritual. He had regained some semblance of his terrible composure, his earlier drug-fueled terror replaced by a cold, murderous fury that was far more dangerous, a rage tempered by iron will. He took the flawed, glittering glass from the trembling hands of a lesser priest with ritualistic solemnity. His attendant priests, Ysmir among them, his face a mask of eager servility, spoke in hushed, reverent tones of Lirath's treachery, of her blasphemous lust for the holy relic. Ghorthus, his eyes like chips of obsidian burning with unholy fire, turned the replica over and over in his bony, skeletal fingers. His knowledge of true relics, of objects of power that thrummed with cosmic force, was profound, born of long years of dark study in forbidden tomes. This thing in his hand was inert. Lifeless. A cheap bauble, a mockery. With a sudden, violent snarl that echoed off the ice walls, he smashed it against the stone floor with savage force. It shattered into a thousand glittering fragments that scattered like broken stars.

"A FAKE!" His roar was not that of a man, but of an insulted deity's chosen vessel, a sound of pure, elemental rage that made the very air tremble. "She is still in the temple! The *true* Shard is still here! The assassin… the foreign she-devil… she played us all for fools! LOCK DOWN THE TEMPLE! SEAL EVERY EXIT! FIND HER! FIND THE SHARD OF NIGHT, OR ZORATHYS HERSELF WILL FLAY THE SKIN FROM YOUR BONES!"

Alarm bells, their brazen voices harsh and clamorous as the cries of damned souls, began to toll throughout the temple complex, a symphony of impending doom that rolled across the frozen city. The lockdown, swift and brutal as an executioner's axe, descended upon Zorathys's domain with iron finality. But Veyra, by then, was beyond their immediate reach, a shadow at the precipice of a dark, yawning opening in the temple's deepest bowels: the charnel pit, the throat of hell itself. Without hesitation, her jaw set in grim determination, she stepped into the stinking, frozen abyss.

## Chapter 6: Retrieval in Horror's Depths

The charnel pit was a black plunge into abject, stomach-turning horror, a descent into nightmare made manifest. The stench of decay, of frozen, putrefying flesh that had lain corrupting for untold years, was a physical blow, a suffocating wave that made Veyra gag and retch. The cold was a crushing, palpable presence, a cold that bit to the bone and stole the breath, a cold born not of winter but of death itself. Vague, monstrous shapes lay haphazardly in the darkness below, a jumbled, frozen testament to the temple's endless, insatiable hunger for death and sacrifice. A scraping sound from above, a sickening thud nearby: another corpse, unceremoniously dumped into the pit like refuse. Veyra pressed her body hard against the icy, muck-slicked wall, every muscle locked in frozen stillness, a silent, desperate prayer on her lips to whatever gods might listen to an assassin's plea, if any gods existed in this frozen hell.

A flickering torch beam, a slash of orange light in the oppressive darkness, stabbed down from the opening above like the eye of some malevolent god. A guard, his face a brutal silhouette against the light, peered into the pit's depths with cold, calculating eyes. Veyra froze, every muscle locked, scarcely daring to breathe, her lungs burning with the effort of stillness. The light passed, sweeping onwards across the field of frozen dead. The temperature in the pit, already beyond mortal endurance, plunged further, dropping to depths that defied nature. A low, sibilant hiss, like steam escaping from a frozen crack in the earth, echoed from the darkness with malevolent promise. Another frost-wraith, a lesser cousin to the one she had faced in the sanctum, born of the pit's accumulated despair and the unnatural cold, coalesced from the swirling muck and shadows, its form wispy but its chilling aura undeniably, terrifyingly real, a manifestation of death's hunger.

The retrieval of the Shard became a nightmarish, desperate struggle against time, against the cold, against the horrors of the pit that sought to claim her. Her numb, clumsy fingers brushed against frozen, unyielding fabric, stiff as armor. The sacrificed dancer. As she forced her stiffening fingers into the crude, ice-sealed cavity she had carved with such brutal haste, the half-formed frost-wraith, a creature of spite and shadow, lunged with inhuman speed, its spectral, ice-sharp claws grazing her arm. Searing, freezing pain, a dual agony of fire and ice, shot through her flesh like molten lead and frozen lightning merged.

Simultaneously, as her fingertips brushed the unholy surface of the Shard, it unleashed its torment upon its would-be wielder. Intense, unimaginable frost surged up Veyra's arm like a living serpent, a living cold that battled the wraith's chill, threatening to encase her limb in a sheath of black ice, to turn her very blood to frozen sludge in her veins. The Shard, the malevolent artifact forged in cosmic darkness, bit its wielder with savage hunger, claiming its price in flesh and agony and years of life stolen.

Instead of Anya's gentle voice, the Shard's alien influence now twisted her perception into a waking nightmare beyond mortal comprehension. The shifting, uncertain shadows on the pit walls seemed to writhe and coalesce with hideous life, forming fleeting, monstrous, half-seen shapes that lunged at her from the periphery of her vision, their silent screams echoing in her mind like the death-cries of a thousand slaughtered souls. A jumbled pile of dismembered limbs, relics of past sacrifices, momentarily appeared to stir with unholy animation, a skeletal hand, crusted with frozen gore, reaching for her with accusatory, grasping fingers, causing her to recoil with a stifled cry of pure, animal terror that threatened to betray her position. Her paranoia, fueled by the Shard's dark power and alien malice, flared like wildfire; every flicker of movement, every drip of icy water from the pit's roof, sounded like the stealthy approach of temple guards or the slithering advance of another spectral horror hungry for her soul. This amplified, unreasoning fear, this soul-crushing sense of being surrounded by unseen, immediate, and monstrous threats pressing in from all sides, was a new and terrible torment, a madness that clawed at the edges of her sanity.

Her frozen fingers, clumsy as blocks of wood, finally closed around the Shard with desperate strength. It pulsed in her grip with a sickening, malevolent thrum, a vibration of pure, cosmic evil that resonated in her bones and teeth. The wraith, now fully formed and terrible in its hunger, loomed before her, its eyes burning with cold, blue fire that promised only oblivion. Veyra, her frost-marked hand a throbbing agony of blackened, dying flesh, her teeth gritted against the pain until her jaw ached, slammed the Shard with all her remaining strength into the wraith's ethereal, swirling chest. An implosive sound, like a thousand icicles shattering at once in a crystalline symphony of destruction, echoed in the confines of the pit. The wraith fractured, its form dissolving into a cloud of glittering ice dust that quickly vanished, banished back to whatever frozen hell had spawned it.

A raw, ragged gasp tore from Veyra's throat as she fought for purchase on the slick, corpse-strewn floor of the pit, her hands sliding on frozen blood and worse things. Her frost-ravaged arm was a throbbing, searing agony of blackened, necrotic flesh, yet she mastered the pain with the iron will of her savage breed, with the strength born of Cimmerian blood and years of hardship. Using the stiffened, frozen limbs of the dead as gruesome, repulsive handholds, her bloodied, torn fingers scrabbled along the pit's sheer, glacial confines, desperately seeking some escape from the treacherous, near-impossible ascent back to the guarded temple passage whence she'd plunged into this icy hell. Her questing touch, raw and bleeding, found it: a jagged, shadowed fissure near the pit's stinking, muck-filled base, a black, narrow maw of a side tunnel, barely wide enough for a starving wolf to crawl through on its belly. It canted upwards into suffocating, impenetrable blackness, the air thick and foul with the charnel reek of ages and the cold, damp miasma of the grave, of things long dead and best forgotten. Into this choking, claustrophobic gullet she thrust her battered body, crawling on her belly like a wounded snake through the bowels of the earth. She emerged at last, not into the temple's heavily patrolled upper reaches, but into a small, ice-locked, forgotten courtyard, evidently an external dumping ground for refuse, hard by the charnel pit itself. From this bleak, desolate sanctuary, a narrow, ice-sheathed defile (little more than a jagged crack in the cyclopean outer wall of the temple, doubtless overlooked by the temple's ancient, long-dead builders) offered a sliver of desperate, improbable hope, a pathway to freedom. Clutching the Shard, its unholy cold an echo of the death that now crept in her own veins like slow poison, every flickering shadow a leering, mocking demon born of her fraying sanity, she forced her battered, bleeding body through the narrow gap with grim determination. The biting, wolf-keen wind of the Grimstrand night smote her like a barbarian's mailed fist, a brutal, savage welcome as she slipped Zorathys's cursed, blood-soaked demesne, the brazen, furious clangor of the temple's alarm bells a fading, impotent snarl at her heels, a promise of future reckoning.

## Chapter 7: Vengeance in Unnatural Night, and an Ominous Future

Weeks bled into a frozen, pain-filled blur, a desperate struggle against the Shard's encroaching, life-sapping chill that threatened to consume her utterly. Veyra, a shadow haunting the frigid underbelly of Grimstrand, observed the 'Silent Hand' guildhall, a squat, stone fortress of ill repute, noting the patterns of its patrols, the strength of its defenses, with the patience of a starving wolf watching a flock of sheep. She dealt with a swaggering, overconfident enforcer in a stinking, refuse-choked alley, a grim, bloody appetizer for the main course of her vengeance yet to come. His wide-eyed, gibbering fear at the unnatural, bone-deep cold that radiated from her, from the Shard she carried like a lover's token, was a small, bitter satisfaction in the vast wasteland of her desolation.

Tonight, under a bruised, starless sky that mirrored the blackness in her soul, she stood like a specter of doom before the guildhall's heavy, iron-bound doors. Summoning the Shard's true, terrifying power was a draining, agonizing ordeal that left her gasping. It leeched her life force, her vital essence, leaving her breathless, her vision swimming in a red haze of pain. Her frostbitten hand, now a blackened, useless claw of dead flesh, throbbed with a relentless, fiery pain that never ceased. The unnatural, Stygian darkness she called forth from the Shard was a hungry, devouring void, coalescing around her like a living shroud of night itself. Each moment spent wielding the artifact felt like years stolen from her own lifespan, like decades bleeding away into nothingness. A faint, mocking whisper, like the rustle of dry bones in a forgotten tomb, seemed to echo in the depths of her mind: Zorathys's distant, icy laugh, her divine disapproval a palpable, crushing pressure against Veyra's will, a weight that threatened to break her.

The Shard drank the dim twilight from the narrow street like a vampire drinking blood, plunging the area into an abyss of impenetrable blackness. Torches on the guildhall walls guttered and died as if snuffed by an unseen hand of death. Inside the den of assassins, shouts of alarm, of sudden, terrified confusion, were abruptly, chillingly silenced as if throats had been cut. Veyra moved through the unnatural gloom like a phantom, a whisper of death incarnate, the Shard's power to disorient and confuse her unseen, impenetrable shield against mortal eyes.

The Guildmaster's sanctum, his private den of plotting and treachery, reeked of incense and old blood. A shimmering, sorcerous ward, a web of crackling blue energy that hummed with ancient power, protected its heavy oaken entrance. As Veyra, a figure of grim resolve, pushed through the ethereal barrier with the Shard held before her like a talisman, the Shard in her grip flared with a blinding, cold light, shattering a nearby crystal decanter of wine into a thousand pieces with a sharp, explosive crack. The ward, ancient and potent, burned like molten ice against her skin, its energies tearing at her flesh and soul. The effort drained her; pain, sharp and searing, etched new lines around her mouth, and a trickle of dark blood oozed from one nostril, freezing on her lip. Her strength, already taxed to its limits, faltered for a crucial, heart-stopping second, her knees buckling slightly under the combined, crushing strain of the ward's resistance and the Shard's relentless, parasitic drain on her vitality. She caught herself with a snarl, a sound of pure, animalistic defiance torn from her throat, pushing through the last vestiges of the ward on sheer, unadulterated will and savage determination.

Beyond the shattered ward, in the opulent, torch-lit chamber hung with stolen tapestries, Guildmaster Vorlag, a gross, corpulent toad of a man, awaited her, flanked by two hulking, silent Khitan bodyguards whose cruel, curved blades were already drawn and gleaming. A detailed map of Grimstrand's sprawling underworld lay spread across a massive, carved oak table like a spider's web.

"Always knew you had ambition, girl," Vorlag rasped, his voice a wet, phlegmy sound, his small, pig-like eyes glittering with a mixture of surprise and malice and a grudging respect for one who had survived so long. "A pity your little sister lacked your… resilience. A necessary lesson, wouldn't you say, to teach obedience to the weak?"

The taunt, crude and brutal and calculated to wound, solidified the ice in Veyra's heart into a core of pure, murderous rage that burned colder than the Shard itself. The fight that followed was a brutal, desperate whirlwind of motion in the Shard-born, flickering darkness. Veyra, hampered by her aching, useless arm and the Shard's constant, debilitating drain that sapped her strength with every heartbeat, moved with the deadly precision of a cornered viper fighting for its life. She used the disorienting gloom to blind one of the Khitan swordsmen, a feint and a sidestep leaving him slashing at empty air while his own momentum carried him forward. Ducking beneath the sweeping blade of the second, she kicked a heavy jade pedestal into his shins with a sickening crunch of bone and cartilage. He howled in agony, a sound abruptly cut short as Veyra's dagger, a sliver of Cimmerian steel honed to razor sharpness, found his throat in a spray of hot, dark blood that steamed in the cold air. The first, still disoriented and stumbling, met his end a moment later, Veyra's blade punching through his leather jerkin and into his heart with brutal efficiency.

Then, Vorlag. His own blade, though wielded with a surprising, desperate cunning for a man of his bulk and soft living, was no match for Veyra's cold fury, a fury empowered by the Shard's cosmic, alien malice and years of training. Her blade, an extension of her will, her hate made manifest, found its mark, sinking deep into his unprotected gut. He collapsed with a wet, gurgling sigh, his lifeblood pooling on the rich carpets of his stolen wealth, his eyes wide with the shock of mortality.

Aftermath. Silence, save for Veyra's ragged breathing and the drip of blood from her blade onto the floor. She moved through the opulent sanctum like a vengeful spirit claiming its due, claiming contracts, ledgers, the guild's black secrets written in cipher and blood. Chilling evidence of far-reaching, insidious influence: plots against a distant Nemedian king, dark dealings with a shadowy Khitan sorcerer of ill repute, unholy alliances forged in shadowy, forgotten realms beyond the knowledge of sane men. Her actions tonight, she knew with cold certainty, would have ripples that spread far and wide, like blood spreading in water, touching lives and kingdoms she would never see.

Her triumph was a cold, bitter thing, tainted by the Shard's unholy presence and the knowledge of what she had become. The artifact pulsed warmly now in her grip, a sickeningly possessive, almost obscene sensation, like the caress of a lover who was also a parasite. Its icy, alien influence was a constant, insidious whisper in her mind, warping her thoughts, twisting her memories into shapes she barely recognized. Anya's memory, once a source of righteous, cleansing anger that drove her forward, was now harder to hold, its warmth fading, replaced by a colder, more abstract sense of loss, a hollow ache where love had once burned bright. The Shard was a parasite, a thing of evil, feeding on her grief, twisting her purpose into something dark and unrecognizable, transforming vengeance into something far more terrible.

The unnatural, localized blizzards that had begun to follow her in Grimstrand intensified, the wind howling like a legion of damned souls crying out for release. As she slipped from the now silent, death-filled guildhall, she paused at the doorway. The ledgers… they were a map to too many secrets, too many enemies, a legacy of blood and betrayal she did not wish to inherit or carry forward. With a grim set to her jaw, she piled them high on Vorlag's great oak table, then touched the Shard to a stray piece of parchment with deliberate care. Unnatural, black frost spread with terrifying speed, then, with a sharp crackle, an icy, corpse-blue flame erupted, consuming the papers in a cold, swift fire that left little ash, only the stench of ancient evil and burning secrets. Wiping her bloodied hands on her ragged furs, she turned to leave Grimstrand forever, to vanish under the cover of the raging, Shard-induced blizzard that now engulfed the city like a shroud.

On a distant, snow-swept rooftop, a flicker of furtive movement caught her eye. A cloaked figure, still and watchful as a gargoyle carved from ice, bearing the silver and black, skull-and-icicle insignia of Zorathys's awakened inner cult: the temple's secret hunters, its executioners who never slept. Their quarry, Veyra knew with a cold certainty that settled in her bones, was now her. A silent, deadly promise of future reckoning hung in the frozen air like a drawn blade. She knew she could not stay in Grimstrand, not now, not ever. Her flight from the accursed city would begin immediately, under the cloak of the storm she herself had inadvertently summoned. But the cult, and perhaps others, sorcerers and worse, drawn by the Shard's violent reawakening like carrion birds to a battlefield, would not be far behind.

Her isolation became absolute, a fortress of ice and despair with walls no mortal could breach. Former contacts, the rats and jackals of Grimstrand's underworld, shunned her, their eyes wide with superstitious fear of her unnatural aura, the palpable cold that clung to her like a shroud of death. The ice storms that dogged her steps became more savage, more widespread, leaving devastation in their wake. New, terrified whispers circulated through the city's frozen alleys: of Veyra, the Shard-Wielder, the butcher of the Silent Hand, of an ancient, bloodthirsty cult stirring from its age-long slumber, its hunters seeking the stolen, unholy artifact, and of powerful, black-hearted sorcerers from distant, sunless lands, their malevolent interest piqued by the Shard's raw, untamed power that called to them across the leagues. Her future, and Grimstrand's, remained chillingly, terrifyingly uncertain, lost in a whirlwind of ice and blood and cosmic horror.

The old skald in the 'Frozen Hearth' let his voice fall, the last words swallowed by the sudden, violent howl of the freak blizzard that now raged outside the tavern walls with renewed fury. "And so," he murmured, his voice barely audible above the storm's fury, "the Shard-Wielder, Veyra the Avenger, walked her path of frozen, blood-soaked vengeance through the world. Whether she found peace at the end of her red road, or merely a colder, more terrible damnation in some forgotten, icy hell beyond the rim of the world, is a tale yet to be sung, a song lost to the howling winds of time and fate."

A nervous, suffocating silence descended upon the tavern, broken only by the rattle of shutters and the crackle of the dying fire that cast dancing shadows on the walls. Then, a young, pale-faced merchant, his eyes wide with terror, swore a guttural oath that drew shocked glances. "By Ymir's frozen beard… as you spoke that last… I saw a figure outside, in the storm. Cloaked. Watching us through the window." He shivered violently, his teeth chattering like dice in a gambler's cup. "Its eyes… they were like chips of blue, burning ice, inhuman eyes." He looked around wildly, his gaze darting from one shadowed face to another, seeking reassurance and finding none. "Then it… it vanished into the storm, like a breath of frost on the wind, as if it had never been."

The skald offered a grim, knowing smile, a death's-head grin in the flickering firelight, his ancient eyes reflecting secrets better left unspoken. The fate of Veyra, the Shard-Wielder, and the dark, ancient forces she had unleashed upon the world, was left to their grim, frost-bitten imaginations. The wind howled, a hungry beast at the door, carrying on its icy breath whispers of shadow, of blood, and of a cold that came not from the winter snows, but from the black, uncaring void between the stars, where elder things dreamed their cold, patient dreams.

The End.
