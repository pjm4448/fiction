# The Ebon Facet: A Lament from the Veiled Abyss

**Synopsis**

Brooke Kai, an ambitious academic at the University of Otago in post-reform 1980s New Zealand, becomes entangled with her charismatic mentor Professor Lachlan, whose forbidden research into impossible geometries and cosmic horrors offers an intoxicating escape from the suffocating neoliberal restructuring crushing New Zealand's university system. Driven by a desire for intellectual validation and misdirecting her rebellious instincts into his ranked academic hierarchy, Brooke helps Lachlan decode ancient texts describing the Vorago Vorax (the Gulper), a cosmic entity of pure chaos, and the Voragine Diadem, an obsidian multi-faceted artifact designed to contain it through a living consciousness acting as a soul-shield or parapet. As Lachlan's praise feeds her ambition and she mistakes his manipulation for mentorship, Brooke participates in a ritual at a remote seaside location where followers gather around the black diamond artifact. Too late, she recognizes that Lachlan's seemingly fatherly guidance was a calculated process of selection, and that she was never meant to be an observer or student but the sacrifice itself: the flexible yet firm awareness to be imprisoned within the Diadem's crystalline structure, her mind consciously absorbing and filtering the Gulper's maddening chaos for eternity while Lachlan advances his academic career unscathed.

*In ebon vaults where facets bleed their night,*  
*A diadem of gulfs, obsidian and drear,*  
*Wakes the gulper's maw to yawn its appetite:*  
*A vortex crowned with thorns of frozen fear.*

*The speck, that frail insurgent of the light,*  
*Surrenders to the ledger's charnel script,*  
*Where merits writhe as maggots in the blight,*  
*And insight's shield dissolves in venom-dript.*

*O cycle roused from slumber's sable pyre,*  
*Where audit's kiss devours the dreamer's throne,*  
*Beauty blooms inverse in the funeral fire:*  
*A rose of voids, thorned exquisite, alone.*

*Through veils of doom, the stare eternal gleams,*  
*Unweaving souls to silks of shattered schemes.*

---

In the black not-void (where emptiness might grant mercy, a brief respite from this endless gnawing) my thoughts swirl, thick as the Taieri River's mud-laden currents, seeping into surfaces that aren't walls but endless loops of self-wrought thorns, each barb a fiscal footnote auditing my unraveling self. No light breaches this place. No sound returns. Only the unyielding pressure of awareness builds, folding vastness and confinement into one choking spiral, a routine erasure where accountability demands its due: the soul reduced to line-item loss, whether by cosmic ledger or dean's decree. Am I a universe in miniature, or a speck caught in the diamond's pitiless stare, crystallized in amber-dark permanence? The question fades, meaningless, as time (that sly serpent, coiling through grant cycles and grant denials) winds and unwinds, hauling me through memories where Dunedin's mist-wrapped towers rise forever, their old stone faces splintering under a decade's unseen strain, the same impersonal grind that splintered departments into data points, scholars into surplus.

Memories flood in without warning, not as straight lines but as shattered mirrors, bending the harbor's cold winds, heavy with rotting kelp and the low wail of foghorns mourning the unburied dead: elegies for the tenure-track ghosts, their ambitions audited into oblivion. The Clock Tower's ancient timbers creaked back then, groaning beneath the weight of centuries, under gas lamps spilling their sickly yellow light across books carved in the rigid hand of a lost empire, their pages murmuring of shapes that scorned the tidy rules of geometry, just as the post-reform spreadsheets scorned the untidy sprawl of humanistic inquiry. And his voice (Lachlan's voice) unrolling like a proof scratched in black stone, each word a soft trap, polished smooth as jet beads on a mourning rosary, turning dry formulas into spells that pulled the mind toward bottomless edges, where enlightenment and erasure converged in the same vertical maw. Lachlan. The name burns not like silver flame but like an open sore, a suppurating wound in the temple of my regrets, slicing open the sharp pain of wants I never spoke, now twisted into poison: the ambition I mistook for insight, the rebellion I funneled into his ranked creed. Mentor? Hidden lover? The words turn my stomach; betrayer, it whispers, a dagger slipped into the outline of my longing, its blade honed to a malachite edge, green with envy's eternal tarnish. Yet I, too, gripped the hilt, burying doubts in the red ink of his praise, yielding to the atrocity of accountability that devours all it tallies.

Those secret nights in Otago's dim archive wings (where banned books hid in corners, their yellowed pages swollen with symbols hinting at skies beyond the approved horizon) play back now in fits and starts, each moment a thread tightening around me in this dark cell, a parapet woven from my own misdirected mercies. Whispers hung in the air, sour as the decay from the post-reform cuts bleeding through the university's bones: the 1984 shake-up, those market-driven decrees that slashed the University Grants Committee, hurling places like Otago into a brutal fight for funding scraps, where output tallies buried teaching, and tenure went only to the cutthroat climbers who audited kindness as inefficiency. Lachlan flourished there, his deep voice a blade gutting the old bonds of shared knowledge, etching ladders of power from the mess of budget gaps and student debt traps. Ladders I climbed with him, mistaking their rungs for revelations, my hidden ethnographies and pilfered primers not true revolt but offerings to his altar of merit. "The new pact, Brooke," he'd say over sherry in his wood-lined den, the sherry's sharp tang on my tongue masking the dust of crumbling spines, his eyes scanning me like a dean's balance sheet, cold as cat's-eye chrysoberyl reflecting nothing but calculated assessment, "is pure merit: rank seized by relentless results, or the market's hidden fist crushes you into nothing." I saw the truth. I nodded. I, the fool architect of my own audit, nodded along, taking his rules for wisdom, blind to how those changes (spawned from Rogernomics' icy math) had forged his rigid faith, a machine of the spirit where drive excused any cut, and my own clarity, that rare spark he praised, became the very metric by which I measured my worth, dooming me to the gulper's indifferent tally.

Deep in those crumbling shelves, surrounded by stacks thick with the scent of outlawed learning, the Voragine Diadem first slipped into my path; not as some crude fossil dragged from the Taieri's earth-shaking fits, but as a lure tangled in Lachlan's talks, a black diamond cut from disaster's iced remains, its faces a sheen of frozen mercury, a twisted web of otherworldly angles that hummed with a silence that devoured will and warped time into loops of shadowed loss, its obsidian heart veined with threads of midnight sapphire, mirroring the audit cycles that devoured departments and warped careers to numerical deficits. Through his eyes, it wasn't dead rock but a ruling riddle, its many-sided shape mocking the straight lines of our small world: surfaces kissing in fiery union, borders bleeding into views forbidden to sound minds, just as the performance reviews bled nuance into numbers, reducing the sublime sprawl of inquiry to disposable deficits. Standing near it woke a slow poison in the blood, a dizzy hymn like the deep rumble of drowned giants, crumbling the gut's quiet defenses. Defenses I had already weakened, channeling my soft revolt, those stolen notes to first-years and whispers of far-off lore, into his promise of deeper struts, the hidden architecture holding it all. And at its dark heart, held in a stillness that laughed at stone's heft and magic's whims, beat the Diadem's eye: a flawless terror drinking light not to gleam but to brood, black as tourmaline cursed by forgotten suns, reshaping rebel minds into maps of endless thought. A soul-shield forged to buffer the frenzy; not salvation but systematized cruelty, the parapet where my awareness would stand eternal guard, softening the gulper's rot for his fleeting gnosis.

*Vorago Vorax*, the name echoes now, a worm burrowed in my brain, spat up from Lachlan's forbidden glossary: those *Unaussprechlichen Kulten* he'd snuck past the watchdogs, their pages sharp with the bite of ancient dust, brittle as sheets of mica peeling from reason's bedrock, much like the contraband memos he'd hoard from the UGC's fiscal purges. The Gulper, that spinning throat, whose motion was a sound like dry ice rasping on iron, grinding in the bowels of boundless gulfs, whose lightest touch old tales damned to madness: sailors hacked to driftwood of broken purpose, their songs smashed into silent smoke, their intents reduced to flotsam in the void's red-inked ledger, their souls ground to the fine powder of crushed moonstone, pale and directionless. To brush its shapeless storm was peak and ruin fused, the height of defiance shattering the mind beyond repair. Yet I sought it, Brooke Kai, not as victim but as ambitious architect, burying doubts in the nectar of his validation, my rare clarity a fatal gamble on forbidden insight. Lachlan's lessons, shared in the Octagon's fading dusk (where the Oval's crowd noise died into the quiet of traded secrets) painted the Diadem as its twin ward, a memory-shield dreamed up by mad thinkers to demand a parapeta, a live barrier: some flexible but firm awareness, walled in the gem's unlit vault, fated to soak up and soften the flood of alien rot, just as the university's meritocratic abattoir demanded live bodies to buffer its budget maws. A *scutum animae*, he called it, his voice thick with a priest's fervent zeal as he unrolled holy writ, funneling the Gulper's rotting frenzy into a mosaic vision for his chosen few, each fragment a carnelian shard of ambition stained with blood-promise. His chosen metrics, audited souls like mine, complicit in the routine of the eraser. I accepted the bargain. I took the step.

Why me? The doubt spins, an endless knot soaked in bitter aftersight: not blind chance alone, but my sharpness laced with ambition's poison, my good-hearted core (that pull toward communal mercies, seen in pilfered primers passed to overwhelmed first-years tangled in the era's degree-mill chains, or hidden ethnographies slipped to the Octagon's mist-shrouded outcasts, their words a thin lace against the neoliberal dark) misdirected into his grid. Those small kindnesses, quick as breaths, held up my fragile guard; now, bent through this facet's frozen net, they taunt me as rebellions half-formed, channeled not outward but upward, into Lachlan's ranked creed, the steel grid of professor's privilege he'd polished in the 1989 shifts. Those rules forcing output checks and quota counts, turning Otago's sacred rooms into a slaughterhouse of merit where my clarity became currency, loyalty the tool for climbing, and kindness the inefficiency I'd audit away in myself. He'd tested me like that, in those seeming fatherly chats under the Octagon's swaying trees: "You bring change, Brooke: a rare clarity in this money mess." Change? This? Scraped nerves, cuts carving my sea of thoughts? "A way past the plain weave, to the deep struts holding it all." Struts. His sermon: the unbreakable laws of school ladders, the rising hymns of teaching's rule, fed by the aftershocks of '84 that cracked teacher bonds, forcing minds like his (and, fatally, like mine) to hoard gifts like siege rations, mistaking systemic control for cosmic unveiling.

In his book of measured rule, every talk was a clause, every nod a bond: he stuck to it with the iron hold of a man who saw the school not as a market but kingdom, its levels holy ties for his rise, his "guiding" a tuned machine to dig soft minds. Minds like mine, softened by the very ambition he stoked. Betrayal, in his sums, wasn't a break but a gift: the right end to the deal I'd co-authored in the shadows, where my giving turned to his frame, my hidden fire, his shield from loose heart's chaos, my epistemological wager sealing the vault. The turn (he named it discussion, not doom). Deny the doom. "The flip of our being, Brooke." His words hang, linked to these knife-thin grids. "A look at the world's bare heart. Just a flash. Through a view I've... tuned." Drawings. So rich. So twisting. Sinful. The many-faced thing. A saint's tale to this hell. Yet I leaned in, burying the tremor of doubt, my rebellion misrouted into his jargon-veiled abyss, the deep struts I craved revealed as mere ledgers of atrocity. "It needs a marker," he listed, voice clean. The cleanness of the wasp to the fly. "A watching marker for the door. Your bend but strong hold... the hold. The seed."

Praise. Yes, its tune bewitched. The seed. To strip the great shadow bare. Doubts... I buried them, down into this swelling room of hurt, compressed like carbon into the diamond of my damnation, my fatal error not naivety but the hubris of the seeker, gambling clarity for forbidden insight in a system rigged to reduce. The seaside shack... far out, wearing away. Salt-spray whispers, a seer's breath. "Cut off from star chatter," he said. The followers... hooded, deep in thought. Fellows? Their eyes... skipped me. Or pinned. Mercy? No. Math. Worship? Not for me. For the role. Set for slot. Pity skipped; rules ruled. Each chant a whirl, whirling to the stream of hate. Hate born of the same nonhuman engine, cosmic or clerical, that grinds intent to flotsam.

Escape's spark swirled, not killed by his ghost-promises. But years of bond... the pull of his world... the charm... I stayed, my agency and the noose I knotted. He called. A ring on the cold stone floor. "Just watch, Brooke." A hand on my shoulder. Icy. So icy. "Stay as the steady whole": the parapet, the metric, the soul I'd volunteered to immure.

The chant. Falling. Not song. Its beat copied the many-faced shape, spiraling, tearing; mirroring the spiral of audit appeals, endless and erasive. The air, thick, electric. The Diadem blurred. Shapes shaking, building. Angles that hurt. The glow, the grid... then the flood. Not sound. Bottom. Pure chaos. Breaking in. Feelings without gates. Sense-storm. Screaming colors like shattered prisms of alexandrite, shifting impossibly between agony and ecstasy. Sound scars. Fear, joy, loss, wonder: melted, breaking to always, reduced to the void's red ink, the bureaucracy's bottom line.

And Lachlan. In the storm, his face formed. Not down. At me. His look... glowing. Glowing with hunger, his pupils dilated to black pearls harvesting my dissolution. And his eyes. No tie. No student's care. Only the hard law of command. A small peak. Seen by none but the unraveling, the one undone. Undone by her own hand, the clarity she'd chased now the chain.

The lie. It cut deeper than the storm. That second... the face set. I was no watcher. No seed. The hold. The worker. The gift: gifted by my own ambition, the tragic yield to a flawed dark enlightenment.

Then... fall. The chaos wave... it didn't wash over. It funnelled. Into me. Stretched. Shortened. Sealed. Down, down, into this... heart. A flash's dead cloud: the churning, hunting, root-wild rush. The *Vorago Vorax*. Seen through my own fading, pulled out and pulled again. Somewhere, deep in the chaos, a chime struck three times, distant and broken, the funeral bell of the Clock Tower sounding out the destruction of all finite time. Chill. Before hurt. Shaped into endless flawless skin. And then... this. This still. This shape-prison of knowing, where the ledger's cruel calculus reigns eternal: the cosmic gulper and the fiscal fist, one maw in two guises, my mind its cruel, endless marker, complicit thrall to the routine erasure I'd sought as revelation.

Time unravels here, bending chronology into a Möbius band: a knotted cloth of moments where years melt into seconds, and Dunedin's rainy evenings blur into drops of madness, each memory a bead of amber trapping extinct instants. Yet Lachlan lingers, a fixed star in this dreamless hell, his lessons nagging like hidden worms, digging deeper with every turn, their venom the mirror of my self-betrayal. His praise was like secret nectar, turning fear to flight; that same praise now bouncing in the Diadem's sound-trap, a twisted overlay on the chaos roar, its irony a blade in the sore spot of my erasure, sharpening the tragedy of my choice: to misdirect rebellion into his struts, to bury doubt for a forbidden knowledge that immured me. Clarity? This broken nerve, these wounds cutting through the sea of my mind? In this spiral's depths, the old tales build not as outside notes but as growths from my own tearing: the Diadem, that *Parapeta Voragine*, not a dead tomb but a living lock, its atom-web (born in heats beyond stars) mocking decay's rule, outlasting mountain births and the slow death of everything, harder than any terrestrial corundum, with my caught thought as its twisted, forever keeper, the epistemological failure I'd authored in ambition's name.

So I linger. Or a drop lingers. The scenes don't change; they fill this ground. A twisting, charm-wound wrong. Each wrong a twist of his ways, his truths (and mine, the complicit weave). Each path the three-fold fall: ambition's lure, rebellion's misroute, erasure's due. Locked. In black. Clear sight, worth, long life: cut. A maze brighter than any, tracing nothing but my maze-songs. Am I the black? Or its hider? Or has the gap gone to nothing? Its clear songs sing only to me, without stopping. Can thought eat black? Can mind burn twisted wrong from inside? Or will it hone the stone of sorrow, sharpening the piece that wraps me through the stars' dry breath? I trace the builds of my lock-up, the frame of this hurt. Each try at straight way out fades, leading to the hurt's heart, the lie, the shiver of the Gulper; and the deeper shiver that this facet, made in dark end, spits on end's end, its speck-frame a curse to unmaking, holding my hex till the all shrinks to ash, my tragedy the eternal audit of a soul that chose its chains.

Time... the word mocks, a king's joke. Does it move? Or just wraps me, another hard edge in this no-heart? The span of kin, faith, god-sight. Bits of fog. The sky will shrink. Lights die. Lens crowds slack. Bits quiet. Ticks. And I... I will stay, this black guard's mute thrall, my sense the spark that flickers in law's shade, outlasting last's gift, a lone ruby ember in entropy's final darkness. Is it watching? Or is this black hall working, making my prayer a sight to blind watchers in times not born? Does some ghost watcher still look through me, using my lost smarts as its bad window on lands I know no more, only bear (till the all's sore sore)? The fear of part, even now, even there, adds ice wind to the age: the fear that my clarity, so praised, was the very metric of my reduction, a complicit ledger in the atrocity's vast account.

No way out. Who would know to seek? No help. The powers, if they see this small spot of bottom, don't care. Or hurt. The Gulper... it ignores, as audits ignore the human cost. Lachlan and his rule... risky. My pain, star-small: yet grown in this one spot, where small grows to endless, the same engine grinding flotsam from intent, whether in void or vice-chancellor's vault.

The true poison... it's not the lack of feeling. Not even the new death I soaked, though it bites at night. It's the sharpness. This hard, rough push of knowing, in the full shadow of nothing but knowing. The clean, many-sided sum of every trick, every stolen look now sick, every step to this... this room of beats: steps I took, ambitious and awry, misdirecting fire into the maw. The grasp that my age is pure, boiled pain. No aim. No stop. Just the quiet, charm-wound bell of a truth twisted in a black clock, where every turn tells only itself, waiting for dawn's fade (and past, into the black diamond's deep gift), my mind the speck that laughs at the many-worlds' tomb, tragic author of its own eternal balance.

In the ritual's chaotic withdrawal, as the final arms of the madness pulled back like skinned veins, the image of Lachlan formed in the hard, cold light of my permanent awareness. I did not see him, yet the Diadem's terrifying clarity forced the reconstruction of his completing actions, which I knew to be true with an absolute certainty woven into the diamond's crystalline logic. I imagined his fingers (the same that once drew approving lines on my marked pages) reaching out with a clerk's calm, settling on the rhomboid stone on his desk, a small echo of the Diadem's twist, its faces murmuring the same forbidden bends, polished bloodstone showing flecks of red like scattered guilt, the mundane facet of cosmic cruelty. And then, I felt, with a devastating, internalized certainty, the smooth, detached gesture of his free hand smoothing the brass cufflink at his sleeve (gleaming like a tenure badge hammered in audit fires, bright as false gold over base metal) marking the shift from ritual to routine, the chilling embodiment of accountability's atrocity: no shadowed guilt, but the plain, maliciousness-free erasure of one life for the ledgers' balance, his ordered world locked not as fraud but as the system's flawless terror, iterated in budget books and black diamonds alike. My captured vision replayed his gaze, cold as the UGC tallies that lifted him through Otago's tight halls, darting to the Diadem's still heart, judging its quiet like a promotion file cleared by numbers, his irises reflecting my imprisonment like mirrors of polished hematite, metallic and unfeeling. "Rare clarity, Brooke," his voice echoes now, drained of sweetness, ringing like the bill for a deal done. Clarity, it mocks in my fracturing thoughts, now a ledger's red ink: my balance spent, his ladder braced against the time's money storms, my complicity the final, devastating strut in the machine I'd helped tune. In that reconstructed beat, the horror crystallizes: not tentacled otherness, but the systematized routine right here, in human halls and stellar gulfs, where my quest for ultimate insight fed the eraser's hunger.

Alone. In this circle of me. Utterly alone. Forever: the tragic yield of a mind that chose the void's ledger for its throne, a consciousness crystallized into the hardest prison, a solitaire diamond of damnation cut by my own hands.

The thing possibly rests in some underground holy place, maybe held with tools that hum of old, raw power. Power akin to the humming servers of administrative oversight, tallying eternities in code. Now and then, under bad lights of strange, cursed skies, I imagine it to shift and gleam soft, its wrong bends sometimes nailing the shocked eye of any who look too long, as performance reviews nail the unwary to their metrics.

The lump at its hard heart, if being holds, stays, beyond-natural still, pure: its beyond-natural lasting a dark telling, holding past the shadow's near-last of laws, the caught ghost its endless, unkillable prisoner, a mind set to know the all's dead end: my mind, immured not in innocence but in the hubris of half-revolt, the epistemological gamble that entangled forbidden knowledge with forbidden validation. Does it show anything of what might be an age-old, quiet truth caught time-free in its hard art, like a wasp preserved in prehistoric amber? Or is it just a point, pulled with bad drive but empty of life? I guess the first, a cutting gift to a rite's sad win. I also push such thoughts as sick dreamers' make. The Voragine Diadem, if truth hides past a dreamer's sheet, stays secret, its secrets hard, locked tighter than vaults guarding the Hope Diamond's cursed brilliance. And if a shield lives in it, it holds in a quiet so holy it screams more of endless anger than any balm, a cold book to the full, soul-tearing calm of the bottom: its black diamond core a sign of the cold-end's empty song, where the hurt one's sharp voice shakes for nothing, lost like a foghorn's wail in the harbor's unreturning swell, the ultimate tragedy: a clarity sought, a complicity sealed, an atrocity authored in the name of insight.

The End.
