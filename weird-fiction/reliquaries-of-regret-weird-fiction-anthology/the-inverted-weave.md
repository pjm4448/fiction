# **The Inverted Weave: A Litany of Silt and Spore**

## **Act I: The Sulphurous Breath**

### **Chapter 1: The Effluvium of Envy**

The inlet lay like a half-forgotten sigh at dusk, its silted waters lapping sluggishly against the rusted hulls of beached boats, their barnacle-crusted flanks tilting into the mud as if exhausted by the endless pull of the tides. Geothermal vents dotted the shoreline, hissing sporadically like old men muttering grievances, expelling curls of steam that hung in the humid air, thick with the tang of sulfur and salt. Roimata moved through the misty underbrush, her boots sinking into the unnaturally soft ground that yielded with a clammy reluctance, as though the earth itself resented her passage. The flax bushes. *Harakeke*, their blades sharp and resilient. Clustered in defiant patches amid the sundews, those carnivorous jewels that glittered deceptively in the fading light.

She knelt by a cluster of sundews, their sticky leaves unfurled like tiny altars to entrapment, each glistening droplet a gossamer sacrament of deceit, ensnaring the light in viscous promises that masked the slow dissolution beneath. The mucilage caught the last amber rays, refracting them into a deceptive honeyed glow that lured the unwary toward inevitable adhesion, a microcosmic echo of the greater snares woven into the fabric of longing itself. Roimata's scarred hands. Rough from years of foraging and binding poultices that healed others but never quite mended her own tattered edges. She reached out.

The first touch was a mistake she repeated deliberately; the blistering slime adhering to her fingertips with an almost sentient grip, its acidic kiss unfolding like the inexorable creep of resentment, raising welts that bloomed against her skin, twin to the festering, corruption coiling deeper in her gut, where envy was not mere absence but a parasitic bloom, feeding on the husk of what might have been. She plucked a leaf anyway, careful not to trigger the full snare, though one did clamp shut on a hapless fly nearby. A wet, crisp pop that echoed sharper than it should, carrying across the inlet like a distant slap, a brittle herald of bindings broken in the otherwise silence of the gathering dusk.

Envy's the worst kind of hunger, she thought, not for the first time, as she tucked the sundew into her satchel. It wasn't just the ache of loss; it was the way it stuck, turning every glance toward Korban into a fresh blister. Years ago, one night tangled in the salt-scented sheets of his boat shed, his hands had traced her scars without flinching. Marks from a childhood accident with boiling water, or so she told people. He had laughed that easy laugh of his, called her "his fierce tide," and for a fleeting hour, she had believed in anchors. Then dawn came, and with it his casual vanishing: a mumbled excuse about the sea calling, a ute rumbling away without a backward glance. No *whānau* ties to bind him, no *whakapapa* demanding he stay. Just her, left adrift, the inlet's indifferent churn the only witness.

Now, glowing fungi clung to the damp roots nearby, their bioluminescent veins pulsing faintly, like the underbelly of some forgotten god stirring in subterranean repose, veins of eldritch pallor threading the loam with a cold luminescence that whispered of vast, unheeding cycles beneath the veil of soil and tide. She scraped them free with a thumbnail. The spores dusted her palms in a cold fluorescence that made her skin itch deeper than the sundews' burn, burrowing not just into flesh but into the tenuous lattice of her resolve, seeding an unrest that mirrored the earth's own subterranean murmurs. The vents belched again, a guttural hiss of steam bursting forth, punctuating the air with a chill that shouldn't have been there in the summer haze, a fleeting intrusion of the void's breath, carrying the acrid perfume of minerals long entombed.

Roimata paused, rubbing her arms. The ground felt... off, as if the silt had shifted under her weight, not quite settling. She shook it off, blaming the gathering dark, and pressed on toward the wharf. The wharf jutted out like a splintered bone, its weathered planks groaning under the weight of crates and coiled ropes. From the underbrush's edge, Roimata watched them. Korban and Aria. Unseen for now, her breath shallow against the flax blades that sibilated warnings she ignored.

He was building a skiff, his tanned arms flexing as he planed a length of kauri wood, muscles honed from years wrestling hulls against the inlet's moods. Sweat gleamed on his skin, carefree as ever, and he paused to wipe his brow, grinning at the woman beside him. Aria sat cross-legged on a crate, her bronze hair tied back with a strip of flax, sketching in a worn notebook. Her fingers danced with charcoal, tracing intricate *kōwhaiwhai* patterns. Swirling spirals and *koru* unfurls that evoked ancestral rivers and new growth. She was all effortless grace, her laughter light as she leaned into Korban, pointing at her page.

"Look, this one's for the prow. Like the old *waka*, carrying stories across the water."

He chuckled, low and warm, leaning down to kiss her temple. "You're a wonder, you are. Makes my rough work look like art."

Roimata's nails dug into her palms, the sundew slime still tacky, now mixing with the pallid glow from the fungi dusting her skin, the mingled residue a luminous patina of her unraveling, each particle a diminutive star charting the slow eclipse of her composure. The sight clawed at her. Their easy harmony, a renewal she could never touch, a fragile idyll suspended in the amber of shared breath, mocking the unraveling threads of her own solitude like petals adrift on a current that bore no regard for the drowned.

A vent nearby chose that moment to erupt, a saturated unraveling of steam bursting skyward, the sound syncing with the lovers' shared laugh like an undercurrent of dissent, a subterranean chorus threading mockery through the air, as if the earth itself conspired in the cruelty of what was withheld. The light was fading fast now, the inlet's waters turning to ink under the bruised sky. Korban stretched, rolling his shoulders with a satisfied groan. "That's enough for today. Hands'll be numb if we keep at it. Fancy a brew back at the shed?"

Aria nodded, closing her sketchbook with a click that echoed against the water. "Aye, and maybe I can show you the rest of those patterns over dinner."

They moved in tandem, efficient as a well-practiced crew. She coiled ropes, he gathered tools, their movements laced with that unforced intimacy. Brushes of hands, shared glances. That twisted like a knife in Roimata's chest. The skiff's half-formed hull sat abandoned under a tarp, promising tomorrows they would claim together. As they climbed into the ute. Korban behind the wheel, Aria sliding into the passenger seat with her satchel. The engine coughed to life, gravel crunching under the tires like brittle bones. Roimata shrank deeper into the underbrush, but the access track curved close to her hiding spot, the miry verge soft and treacherous.

The ute lurched forward, gaining speed on the uneven ground. The wheel caught a rut filled with rainwater and mud. It spun once, twice, kicking up a filthy arc that sprayed across the bushes. Straight onto Roimata. The mud hit her like a slap: cold, gritty clods splattering her shirt, her arms, beading on her scarred skin like dark accusations, warm at first from the churned earth then cooling to a clammy film that evoked the earth's excretions, a baptism in recycled hurt, each droplet a petty sacrament of the cosmos's vast apathy, anointing her in the detritus of motions that cared not for the brittle vanities of flesh or grudge. She staggered back, gasping, the sundew welts on her hands now smeared into muddy camouflage, the blended filth a grotesque emulsion that clung with the tenacity of unrequited memory, blurring the boundaries between wound and world.

The ute braked with a skid, tires whining on the gravel. Korban leaned out the window, his face a mix of surprise and amusement in the headlights' glow. Aria peered over his shoulder, brow furrowed but silent. "Looks like the inlet's tryin' to claim ya tonight, Roimata\!"

His laugh was easy, the wisecrack landing light as he revved the engine once, impatient. No offer to help, no pause for concern. Just that quick dismissal, offering no apology, as if her mud-caked figure was merely another unsightly quirk of the tide's mechanical churn. The ute rolled forward again before she could muster a reply, taillights fading down the track, leaving her in the gathering dark with the vents' mocking bursts punctuating the rain's first patter. Roimata wiped a streak from her face, tasting grit and resentment, the mud seeping into her pores like fresh-spilled spite.

She trudged toward the old *pā* shed, which she had reclaimed as her archive. A moldy sanctuary of stacked crates and yellowed ledgers, its walls patched with corrugated iron that rattled in the breeze. Rain had begun to fall in earnest, drumming on the inlet's surface and mingling with the echoing snaps from the underbrush. The sundews claiming another victim, perhaps, or the vents' persistent dissent. A *pōhutukawa* tree loomed nearby, its crimson canopy drooping like a weary sentinel, roots gripping the earth in gnarled reluctance, as if witnessing too many secrets spilled into the soil.

Inside the shed, the air was thicker, laced with the must of rotting paper and drying herbs. Roimata lit a lantern, its flame flickering over shelves of glass jars. Dried *kawakawa* for aches, *mānuka* for wounds that wouldn't close. But tonight, it wasn't the healing she sought. She unslung her satchel, spilling the sundews and fungi onto a scarred workbench, their slime pooling like unspoken grudges, a clammy tableau of latent malice where bioluminescent spores drifted lazily in the mucilage, evoking the slow gestation of forbidden rites in the shadowed recesses of forgotten tomes.

The rain intensified, a steady hiss against the roof. She worked in its rhythm, her hands steady despite the welts rising on her skin, the mud flaking off in crusty reminders. Flax blades waited in a basket. *Harakeke* she had harvested respectfully before, under the moon's proper phase, intoning *karakia*, sacred incantations, to honor the plant's spirit. In Māori lore, the *harakeke* was *whānau*, or family, made manifest: the central *rito*, or child shoot, cradled by parental leaves, all sheltered by the elders' broad fans. Weaving from it bound not just fibers, but lives. *Whakapapa*, the unbroken genealogy threading back to the ancestors, forward to the unborn. Protection, continuity, a weave against the world's unraveling, a defiant lattice against the encroaching entropy that gnawed at all lineages with the patient relentlessness of tides eroding stone.

Roimata began as tradition demanded, stripping the blades clean, checking for the proper *Rito*. The dark central strip that must never be cut, lest the plant's life force bleed out. She selected three: mother, father, child. Her fingers, callused and sure, started the plait. Over, under, a simple three-strand bind that grew into a cord, supple and strong. As she worked, she intoned the old words, half-remembered from her grandmother's lessons: "*E harakeke, e whānau, kia ū mō ā muri ake nei...*" O flax, O family, be steadfast for those who come after.

But midway, her rhythm faltered. The image of Korban's arm around Aria flashed again, that effortless renewal she could never claim, the mud still beading on her skin like fresh-spilled spite. The cord in her hands felt mocking now. Too neat, too whole. With a sharp inhale, she gripped the plait and yanked.

The fibers resisted at first, tough as ancestral oaths, then gave way with a fibrous rip. Not one, but a cascade, threads fraying like severed lines in a family tree, bursting free in chaotic spite, each rupture a libation to the void's insatiable maw, unraveling the sacred braid into a desecrated skein where continuity dissolved into the sorrow of deliberate desecration. She knotted them roughly after, twisting the sundew slime into the joins, embedding the glowing fungi's spores like forbidden seeds, infusing the weave with a pulsing bioluminescent venom.

The cord now actively harbored the nascent stirrings of an otherworldly blight, drawn from the unfathomable depths to corrode the illusions of harmony. No protective weave this; it was a rupture, a deliberate tear in the *whakapapa's* fabric, inviting something vast and uncaring to seep through their bonds. Korban's carefree drift, Aria's innocent patterns, all to fray at the edges, yielding to the cosmic decree that all blooms must wither into stillness.

As the final knot cinched, a shiver raced up her arms, colder than the rain seeping through the shed's seams, a premonitory tremor as if the air itself recoiled from the alchemical trespass, molecules ensnaring one another in a thickening pall that evoked the first stirrings of a Stygian fog, veiling the blasphemy in a ponderous shroud of foreboding beauty. The air thickened, heavy as if the air's constituent parts had snagged on her desecration.

Outside, the *pōhutukawa's* roots seemed to creak, gripping tighter, and the ground beneath the workbench heaved subtly. A soft undulation, like the earth drawing breath in protest, a subterranean sigh pregnant with the weight of unheeded lineages fracturing beneath the surface. The rain's patter stuttered, then resumed with a sharper edge, while from the inlet came the amplified chorus: a wet snap from the sundews, another from the vents, and now, an echo from the sundered cord itself, its fibers twitching as if alive with recoil, an eldritch susurrus threading the gloom like the presage of forgotten gods rousing to witness the seeding of their own apathetic harvest.

Roimata leaned close to the knotted cord, her voice a low hiss laced with venom, the words spilling out like the first drops of a gathering storm: "May your lines tangle like mine, your patterns bleed into nothing." She exhaled, a triumphant tremor in her chest. The curse hung incipient, subtle as sediment in the tide, the quiet initiation of her vengeance. This grudge was alchemized into something that would erode their idyll from within, once properly rooted, its tendrils destined to unfurl in the shadowed interstices of their bliss, blooming into a decadent decay that mirrored the universe's own unhurried unmaking.

For now, she set the cord aside on the workbench, wrapped in a scrap of oilcloth to stifle its protesting twitches, the mud still caked on her skin now mingling with the rain as she extinguished the lantern. As she stepped out into the downpour, the sharp reports lingered in her ears, a protesting litany that followed her home through the dark.

### **Chapter 2: The Pawnbroker's Profane Forfeiture**

The rain had softened to a persistent drizzle by mid-morning, veiling the fringe market in a haze of fog that clung to the narrow lanes like the exhaled breath of some vast, slumbering entity, muting the colors of stalls hawking wilted produce and trinkets salvaged from the tide. Smoldering flax torches lined the paths at intervals, their flames sputtering against the clammy air, sending curls of lazy, acrid smoke upward to mingle with the runoff that slicked the ground underfoot. Puddles beading with an oily sheen from spilled oils and unguents, each step sent ripples outward, an echo of the inlet's distant, rhythmic churn.

Roimata navigated the crowded stalls with a purpose that bordered on predatory, her basket slung low across her hip, the weight of its contents a constant reminder of the morning's harvest, while the accursed cord's absence left a hollow throb in her pocket where she had tucked a single remnant thread, rough against her fingers like a talisman of intent. The blister from the sundews had deepened overnight into a sticky welt that pulled taut with every flex of her blistered palm, sending fresh stings up her arm, but it fueled her resolve rather than deterring it, a visceral reminder of the adhesion she now meant to turn outward, weaponizing the inlet's own cruel opportunism against those who had left her adrift.

The pawnbroker's shop hunkered at the market's dimmest edge, where the fog thickened into near opacity, its facade a grotesque mosaic of tarnished signs swinging creakily in the breeze and beaded curtains that scraped lazily against the doorframe. A tarnished threshold parting to admit the profane, where the veil of everyday barter thinned to reveal the subtle hydraulics of desperation churning beneath, foul as the vents' buried sigh.

Brine jars lined the threshold in uneven rows, their glass clouded with condensation, pale worms coiling lazily within the murky liquid, their slow, sinuous writhe hypnotic against the distorted glass, each bubble's burst mimicking the vents' wet hiss, a small enactment of the universes' unyielding decay, where even the lowliest forms pulsed with the tragic beauty of inevitable unmaking. Roimata pushed through the beaded curtain with deliberate force, enduring the sharp sting of the shells against her blistered palm. The scrape raw and immediate, echoing the flax's earlier fibrous protest. And stepped into the cloying incense that hung heavy in the confined space, a musk of salt and decay twisted with something sharper, more primal, like the inlet's underbelly exposed to the light and found wanting.

Reid looked up from behind a counter strewn with an assortment of fake gems that caught the low light in mocking facets and tarnished silver rings piled in careless heaps, their dull gleam flickering like corrupted stars on the verge of collapse. Bald and ringed with the grime of unwashed dealings that seemed to adhere to the very air around him, he wheezed a greeting through a gluttonous frame that strained the buttons of his threadbare shirt, his eyes. Small and glinting with the cold opportunism of shadowed trades. Narrowing as they took her in. "(Wheeze..) Look at you. Broke as a snapped oar, aren't ya? Here for a love charm, or a proper spite-knot for the sheila he's running with?"

His voice was a gravelly rumble, laced with the false camaraderie of those who profited from desperation, the words hanging in the incense-thick air like barbs designed to hook. Roimata set her basket down on the scarred counter with a soft thud that made the fake gems jitter, the wood groaning under the unexpected weight. She met his gaze without flinching, her chin lifting slightly in defiance of the vulnerability she felt coiling in her chest. The air stung her eyes like the brine's pervasive haze, heavy with the worms' slow, undulating dance in their jars, each bubble's pop as it burst underscoring the threshold she had crossed into this den of forfeitures.

Korban's mocking laugh from the wharf the evening before echoed unbidden in her mind, a fresh splinter driving deeper into the raw wound of abandonment. Not just a personal slight, but a severing of the plain threads she had tentatively offered in that one-night vulnerability, threads now to be masked in the shimmer of borrowed illusions. "Nothing fancy, Reid. Just some small illusions to fool the eye. Glamours that shimmer like heat off the vents, veiling what's meant to fester unseen."

Reid leaned forward across the counter, his multiple rings clinking dully against the wood, the fake gems scattering fractured rainbows that danced mockingly across her scarred hands and seemed to highlight her poverty in their artificial gleam. "Ah, the dodgy stuff, eh? Veils for grudges that bite back. Your pockets are as empty as a beggar’s bowl, love. No dosh jingling in that basket of weeds. *Whiro* takes his cut in flesh for the real bargains; come back here to the nook, and we'll square it proper-like."

His wheeze carried the weight of countless such bargains struck in the shop's dim clutter, greed, decay, and lust intertwined in the very beams overhead, the beaded curtains still rattling behind her like a veil on the verge of thinning, admitting glimpses of the market's bustle that felt worlds away. She followed him without protest to the nook at the rear of the shop, a cramped alcove partitioned by sagging drapes heavy with dust and the reek of previous transactions, the floor gritty with unseen residue of spilled salts and forgotten offerings that crunched under her boots.

The degrading act unfolded in the alcove's stifling shadows, his bulk pressing with an impersonal insistence that stripped away any illusion of agency, her body yielding not in surrender but in cold calculation. A profane toll exacted for the tools to lure and unmake what had unmade her, the transaction a depraved surrender to the void's fetid torrents, where flesh became mere currency in the grand, uncaring exchange of desires fraying into entropy's silence.

Amid the press of flesh and labored breaths, visions flickered unbidden across her mind's eye: the sprawl beyond the shop's walls, unheeding to her stifled gasp, stars wheeling in silent veils of dissolution that made her own degradation seem trivial, the walls' icy chill closing in like the earth's recoiling embrace against such base exchanges, a vacancy where fleeting ecstasy dissolved into the greater wound of existence's mechanical persistence. A shift came then, subtle at first, to a sublime nothing. A hollow expanse where the act's raw immediacy merged with the choral under-hum of bubbles popping in the brine jars beyond.

His insistent delving into her most guarded hollow. The thrusting yielding a muddy slurping echo like the inlet's turbid churn disturbed by a probing tide, a sluggish protest that slurped and clung, tethering the intrusion to the landscape's own reluctant disgorgement. Her resolve blistered further against the intrusion of his touch, the distant vents' snaps audible through the rain's steady patter on the tin roof, blending with the jars' persistent bursts in a dissonant underscore that thrummed in her veins like the first tenuous echo of the curse's borrowed momentum.

When it ended at last, the air in the nook thicker and more oppressive than before, laced with a sour, pervasive smell of sulfur and wet flesh, Reid disentangled himself with a satisfied grunt. His withdrawal was slow, deliberate, a retreating tide dragging silt from the depths, his spent member slipping free from the clench of her violated hollow with a wet, reluctant schlick, like the inlet's mud yielding a buried root to the probing current, leaving behind a raw, gaping vacancy that throbbed with the echo of intrusion, the tender ring of muscle fluttering in protest against the sudden absence, bruised and inflamed as if kissed by the vents' subterranean fury.

In that instant of release, a low, involuntary rumble stirred within her, coiling up from the disturbed viscera like pressure building in the earth's fractured veins. A geothermal sigh escaped her unbidden. A soft, hissing exhalation of gas, warm and acrid, redolent of brimstone and mineral decay, bubbling forth with the petulant insistence of a vent erupting in the inlet's shadowed fringe. It hung briefly in the stifling air, a fleeting curl of steam from hidden fissures, carrying the faint, rotten-egg tang of depths long suppressed, as if the landscape itself had borrowed her body's profane forfeiture to voice its own indifferent dissent, seeding the nook with spores of subterranean malice that mingled indistinguishably with the reek of their transaction.

Reid tossed the vellum scrolls onto a rickety side table nearby, their edges tattered like the ghost threads of her ruined cord, symbols writhed across the surface in ink that shimmered with an otherworldly iridescence. "There ya go, then. Veils for your little games of spite. Don't say I didn't warn ya. They twist back on the weaver if you're not careful, love."

Roimata snatched them up with hands that still trembled, rolling the brittle parchment tight until it fit neatly into her basket, the cool texture against her heated skin a brief anchor amid the lingering throb, and slipped out into the easing rain without a backward glance or word of thanks. Puddles along the market path reflected her smeared face in fractured shards that multiplied her expression into a mosaic of quiet fury, like *whakapapa* lines splintered mid-weave and scattered, the ground rumbling underfoot in what felt like affirmation. Or perhaps a subtle warning. As if the sinful deal had stirred something slumbering below the surface.

A deeper throb uncoiled in her sides as she walked, syncing with the vents' distant sigh carried on the breeze and a final wet slap from the underbrush bordering the market's edge, the fog parting reluctantly around her form like a shroud reluctant to release its claim. The scrolls weighed light in her basket amid the sundews and fungi, but their promise adhered to her thoughts like the worms' unblinking gaze from the jars. Glittering falsehoods crafted to cloak her grudge in harmless shimmer, accelerating the chain of illicit trades that widened the tear in her own continuity. Greed's echo lingered in the air behind her, glinting in every tarnished ring and false gem she passed, the beaded rattle of the shop's curtain fading into the drizzle like a threshold sealed against further pursuit.

### **Chapter 3: The Cauldron's Canticle**

Night draped the moldy archive shed in a profound silence broken only by the erratic flicker of a single tallow candle set on a makeshift ledge, its flame guttering and spitting shadows across the yellowed plant logs stacked haphazardly and cracked heirlooms that cluttered the shelves like the discarded bones of forgotten rituals. The air hung thick and stagnant with the mingled scent of damp paper curling at the edges, and an underlying rot, and sulfur that seeped from the walls themselves. The timber sodden and protesting with irregular creaks that synced eerily with the distant belch of geothermal vents, a rhythmic undercurrent threading through the solitude like an uninvited pulse.

Roimata moved with the ritual precision of one who had long communed with the land's hidden pharmacopeia, dragging a blackened iron pot. Its pitted surface scarred from countless brews of salves and teas in days when her hands healed rather than harmed. To the scrap hearth improvised in the center of the uneven floor, now destined to cradle something far more unwholesome than any remedy. She traced a chalk mandala on the floorboards around the pot with deliberate strokes, circles interlocking in a geometry of denial and containment, the powder gritty and cool under her nails as it dusted her fingertips, each line drawn as a precarious barrier against the release she would deliberately withhold, a geometric ward against the chaos she invoked.

The ingredients waited patiently in her basket, harvested under the day's reluctant sun that had barely pierced the overcast: *tōtara* sap, drawn painstakingly from the tree's resilient gum with a knife's careful incision for its unyielding cohesion in bindings and balms, thick and amber as fresh-spilled resin, pouring into the pot with a congealed sigh, filling the air with its resinous tang; nightshade berries, plump and dark as storm clouds, crushed under the heel of her palm to release their toxic seep in a dark pulp, channeling a venom meant to poison wills and sow creeping doubt in the heart's quiet corners; sundew slime, harvested fresh that afternoon from the inlet's traps, its insidious adhesion harvested by scraping the leaves clean, ready to ensnare spirits like threads caught in a weaver's accidental snare; glowing fungi spores, dusted in last from a small pouch, their throbbing pulses captured in the dim light to warp visions with chthonic resonance that eroded the tenuous hold of sanity over perception. Each element a sinful offering to the cauldron's maw, their essences mingling not in restorative grace but in an alchemy of perversion, where sap's amber gleam evoked the bruised luminescence of dying stars, berries' pulp a numinous shadow blooming against the void's canvas, slime's cling a silken decay that sighed of bonds fraying into entropy, and spores' subtle throbs a choral under-hum summoning the machinery of unmaking from the aether’s mechanical forge.

She kindled the fire beneath the pot with flint and tinder gathered from the shed's corner, embers glowing a sullen red in the grate, and took up the charred *mānuka* stick. Its wood once sacred in *rongoā* lore for the purifying smoke of healing ceremonies, now seized in her grasp to channel the sacred fire into cursing embers that scorch rather than cleanse. As she stirred the mixture counterclockwise in deliberate inversion of the traditional clockwise invocations, the char flaked away into the brew like desecrated ash from a trampled altar, the air filling with a bitter, spirit-scorching tang that clung to her lungs like the residue of violated breath, each languid pass of the stick eliciting wet gurgles from the bubbling slime and sap as they merged, harmonizing with the vents' distant, rumbling belch that vibrated through the walls. A desecrating incantation rising in languid spirals, where the brew's roil mirrored the geothermal depths' unrest, snaps and belches weaving a dissonant canticle that thrummed with the beauty of inversion, sacred rhythms twisted into the grind of decay's inexorable hymn, the air thickening with fumes that evoked not renewal but the unraveling of all patterns under the unconcerned wheeling of constellations.

The blister on her palm ached sharper now with every stir, a throbbing reminder of the grudge's deep root in her flesh, driving her to infuse the potion with a will-venom that ensured its insidious spread beyond the physical, seeping into emotions like ink through water. Internal invocations escaped her lips in fragmented Māori phrases twisted from protective *karakia*. Half-curses invoking no benevolent ancestors but the void's oblivious forge, words like "*kōrero kino*" warped into pleas for unraveling. As the brew simmered to a low boil, steam rising in languid curls that twisted and coiled like the moss-draped boughs of podocarp trees in a fern-choked arcade lost to time.

Roimata stripped off her shirt in the candle's wavering light, the sudden chill of the air raising bumps across her exposed skin like the land's own gooseflesh, her breasts bared to the flickering glow. Full and shadowed like the nightshade berries she had crushed earlier, their curves a voluptuous swell of bruised plum beneath the flame's caress, nipples tightening to dark, venomous points that pricked the humid air with an insistent allure, evoking the sundew's treacherous beads of nectar, glistening invitations to entrapment amid the profound peril of forbidden touch. She knelt within the mandala's chalk embrace, her hand trailing downward in raw, unsparing exploration of her own form.

The self-pleasuring built in relentless waves, muscles clenching against the floor's chill grit that bit into her knees, sweat mingling with the sap's sticky residue in slick trails down her spine, but she denied each cresting peak with iron will. A searing knot twisted in her gut, like the sundew's burn amplified tenfold, her scar throbbing in visceral protest as if the flesh itself recoiled from the toll exacted. Droplets spilled despite her control, blurring the chalk lines of the mandala into smeared ghosts.

Outside, the vents exhaled in dissonant harmony with the brew's bubbles, their heavy exhalation a choral witness to the earth’s turmoil. The act was degrading yet charged with a forbidden electricity, her body transformed into a vessel blending the razor's edge of ecstasy intertwined with self-inflicted annihilation. A ritual of agonising denial, where pleasure's denied crest evoked the cosmos' vast indifference, waves crashing not to release but to erode the self's delicate contours. Sweat and sap traced opulent rivulets like veins of crimson petals wilting against the chill, the mandala's smear a prophetic veil parting to reveal the melancholy feast of entropy's self-devouring bloom, the vents' heavy exhalation a choral witness to the flesh's momentary defiance against the void's relentless tenacity.

As the feigned climax yielded at last to circular denial, leaving her breathless and slick with effort, she pricked her thumb sharply with the *mānuka* stick's charred end, anointing the brew with a few deliberate drops of blood. An unholy sacrament that poured life's hot essence into entropy's unyielding chalice, the droplets hissing on the roiling surface like distant stars quenched in an uncaring sea.

The fungi spores released their susurrus then, brushing against her ears like the fronds of unseen ferns in a humid hush, stirring unbidden images that flickered at the periphery of her vision: a geothermal-warmed hollow deep in the inlet where vents sighed in choral echoes of ancient discontent, the archive's timbers creaking in subtle recoil as if the very structure sensed the perversion unfolding within its walls. The air thickened further with an electric life of its own, fumes swirling upward in fleeting arboreal shapes. Elaborate visions of unmaking where personal venom transmutes inexorably to universal decay, laced throughout with the acrid scorch of *mānuka's* betrayed spirit rising like incense from a desecrated fire, the wet gurgles from the brew swelling into a protesting pulse that thrummed against her temples. A gnostic anointing where blood's hiss merged with the elixir's canticle, spores' murmurs evoking the void's numinous fringe, where hollows and creaks summoned the earth's recoiling viscera in curling arabesques, fumes' shapes a disastrous diorama of transmutation, personal spite alchemized into an ironic jest, incense's scorch a lingering perfume of betrayal that perfumed the silence with the phosphorescent rot of all sacred intents dissolving into the greater wound of pointless existence.

She sealed the flask at last with a cork carved from elder pith, the pox's essence captured within as a subtle itch that prickled against her palm through the glass, its unnatural warmth pulsing like a reluctant heartbeat in the cooling night. The mandala's lines had smeared to indistinct ghosts under the spill of her efforts, the pot's embers dying to gray ash in the grate, and Roimata rose on unsteady legs that trembled from the ordeal, dressing slowly in the humid gloom that presses close.

Stepping out into the night air, cooler now with the rain's lingering memory, the harbor's song swelled in subtle response. A subsonic pulse rising from the waters, carrying the charged vessel in her basket toward her abode. The ground beneath her feet laced with a protesting tremor that traveled up her calves, a low, liquid sigh from the settling puddles underscoring the desecration's irrevocable finality. The alchemy hummed in her veins like a foreign rhythm, envy transmuted into entropic contagion ready to bloom, the *whakapapa* wound she was about to unleash was now infused by healing's cruel betrayal. *Rongoā's* sacred smoke now a vector for the emotional scorching of bonds, the inlet's sanguine undulations stirred at last to root the void's engine deep in the fray of familial continuity, its pulse a revelation where the flask's itch mirrored the veiled abyss's allure, contagion's bloom a petal-strewn procession toward the unweaving of every thread, harbours under-hum a languid lullaby cradling the curse's inexorable drift into the night's endless expanse.

### **Chapter 4: The Buried Knots, Fissure's Whisper**

Dawn crept over the wharf like a reluctant thief slipping through the cracks of the fog, heavy with salt and the acrid tang of geothermal vents resonating far below. Pōhutukawa roots twisted through the rutted tracks like ancient fingers, gripping the earth as if to anchor it against the pull of the tide. Roimata moved through the mist, her boots sinking into the soft gravel with a muted crunch, the spite-knotted cords bundled in her scarred hands. They felt alive against her palms. Warm, almost pulsing, the frayed flax fibers matted with dried mud from the archive shed, their warped patterns catching the weak light like veins under thin skin.

She had carried them through the night, a nocturnal pilgrim bearing relics of unraveling kinship, whispering to them as if confiding secrets to the stars that wheeled above the inlet's shrouded horizon. The cords, once guardians woven from *harakeke's* unyielding grace, now drank her vented litanies of betrayal: Korban's heedless chuckle, that once-warm cadence of shared forges and salt-sprayed dawns, contorting into the serpentine mockery of abandonment; Aria's bronze hair spilling over a sketchpad like threads of pilfered auroral light, illuminating intimacies Roimata could only trace in the margins of forgotten ledgers.

Each syllable she breathed into the fibers summoned a subtle tremor, as if the threads themselves yearned toward some infernal chorus beneath the world's crust. A harmonic decay where human vows dissolved into the silt of entropy's patient tide. Yet in that furtive vigil, a sumptuous splendor flickered: the knots' emergent barbs, gleaming like frost-rimed thorns in the lantern's faltering glow, evoked not mere spite but a somber opulence, beauty's fleeting inscription upon the void's unyielding parchment.

Now, as the first anvil echoes rang from distant workshops. Korban's shed among them. She knelt beside the *pōhutukawa* that shadowed their boat shed. Its crimson canopy loomed overhead, petals already shedding in the clammy air, a scatter of faded warnings on the ground. The tree's roots arched like a ribcage, exposing pockets of loamy soil that yielded too easily under her fingers, as if the earth itself anticipated the intrusion.

Roimata paused, her breath fogging in the chill. She remembered the old stories from the archive's crumbling pages: *harakeke*, the flax of her people, not just fiber but a living thread of *whakapapa*, binding whānau across generations. Woven right, it warded off harm, its patterns a map of ancestry. Strong, interlocking lines that held families whole against the world's unraveling. But she wasn't weaving protection. No. She traced the cords' original form, a simple protective braid she had unraveled, threads pulled loose with deliberate tugs until they snapped like brittle bones.

Each break had sent a shiver up her arms, a raw vibration that lingered now, echoing in her chest. With a steadying inhale, she continued the inversion. Her fingers, rough from years of grinding herbs and turning brittle pages, wrestled the frayed cords into spiteful knots, each loop a deliberate invocation of discord's transcendent geometry. Jagged patterns that mocked the ancestral spirals of harmony, evoking the universe's grand indifference where even the most intricate bonds fray into ornamental dust.

Visions flooded her then, not as fevered phantoms but as lapidary vignettes etched upon the mind's vault: Korban's hands, those once-steady architects of hull and heart, fumbling a chisel amid the forge's ember-kissed haze, the blade skittering like a condemned soul across wood's reluctant grain; Aria's lines, those sinuous evocations of inlet and memory, blurring on vellum as if the pigments themselves recoiled from their own creation, dissolving into inky nebulae that breathed of beauty's inexorable eclipse.

The cords resisted at first, fibers curling away as if scorched by an unseen empyrean fire, a thrum reverberating through the weave like a muffled rebellion from the planet's molten underbelly. Geothermal hymns to the chasm, where tectonic sighs compose elegies for surface illusions. Roimata pressed on, twisting the patterns into deliberate chaos. Loops that overlapped wrong, ends shredding into barbs that caught the dawn's pallid gleam like jeweled relics from a submerged necropolis.

The air thickened around her, carrying a viscous, primeval reek from the soil she had disturbed, a briny exhalation redolent of oceanic crypts where coral cathedrals crumble into silken sediment; and as she tested the final knot against the scar on her palm. The one Korban's abandonment had left like a half-healed burn, a cicatrix of passion's petrified bloom. It warmed unnaturally, heat blooming under her skin in radial pulses, as if the knot had tapped some subterranean vein of ardor, fusing her spite to the earth's own melancholy.

She dug then, the soil parting with an unnatural softness, clumping to her hands like sticky residue from a sundew trap. It clung, that slime-thick mud, seeping into the cracks of her skin with an insistent itch that started as a prickle and sharpened to fire. Roimata gritted her teeth, burying the cords deep under the roots, patting the earth flat with palms that already reddened. The ground heaved subtly beneath her. A low, almost imperceptible shift.

As she rose, wiping her hands on her trousers, the itch spread, a burning thread tracing up her wrists, coiling like vinelike runes in a forbidden codex, its runic fire both penance and sacrament to the relentless engine beneath. The roots seemed to tighten their grip around the buried spite, affirming the binding in silence, while the fog swirled thicker, veiling her retreat to the eaves of a nearby shed.

From there, shrouded in shadow, Roimata watched. The wharf was waking: shutters rattled in the geothermal gales, carrying hisses from the vents that synced with the low buzz rising through her soles. Subterranean, patient, like roots seeking purchase in wounded earth. Korban's shed door creaked open, spilling lantern light onto the road. He emerged first, tanned and broad-shouldered, hauling a slab of kauri wood outside toward his bench. Aria followed, her bronze hair tied back, a trestle under one arm and a satchel of inks slung over her shoulder. They moved with that effortless rhythm Roimata envied. The kind built on shared mornings, unscarred by old slights.

Korban set to work without a word, his chisel biting into the wood for a hull joint, an inherited technique passed down from his father: precise angles that locked like *whānau* ties. The first strike rang true, metal on wood a clean echo. But on the second, his hand slipped. Just a fraction, the chisel veering as if the grain actively soured. A splinter cracked free, the joint's edge fracturing along a line that shouldn't have been there. The tool clattered against the bench, a dull thud that hung wrong in the air, drawing a wary glance from a wharfie passing with a net slung over his shoulder.

"Watch the grain, Korban," Aria called from her trestle, sketching *kōwhaiwhai* patterns in the lantern's glow. Spiraling vines meant to echo the inlet's curves, a nod to the land's memory. Her brush dipped into black ink, tracing a familiar loop. But as she lifted it, the line bled, the ink pooling outward like an accusation, twisting the spiral into something malformed. She frowned, dipping again, only for the next stroke to fade mid-curve, as if the vellum rejected it.

"Easy on the mess, love. It's buggering up my lines here."

Korban grunted, resetting the chisel. "Rubbish light this morning. Or just my rubbish hands?"

He swung again, harder, and the slip came sharper: the blade gouged too deep, the joint splitting with a dry pop that echoed like the flax's earlier tear. Shards scattered across the bench, and he swore under his breath, rage flickering in his eyes. Masking something deeper, a vulnerability that tightened his jaw. The wharfie paused, peering over, his face creasing.

"That hull's joints look cursed, mate," he said, voice low but carrying on the wind. "Your old man's weave gone wrong? Better not touch our gear." He shifted the net to his other shoulder, stepping back as if the wood might carry contagion.

Korban straightened, wiping sweat from his brow despite the chill. "What're you on about? Bad batch of timber, that's all." But his voice held an edge, splintered like the cords Roimata had buried.

The buzz deepened then, coiling up from the ground like the resonant prelude to some chthonic oratorio, syncing with the distant rumble of thunderheads gathering over the inlet. Roimata felt it in her bones, a vibration that matched her pulse, the itch on her palms flaring in rhythm, each throb a stanza in the poem of petty vengeances elevated to cosmic pathos: the subtle sabotage of craft and caress, where lovers' symmetries splinter into baroque asymmetries, their once-resplendent accord now a mosaic of nascent fissures, beheld from afar as if through the haze of a dying star's corona. Beautiful in its unraveling, meaningless in its predestined dispersal.

From the eaves, she savored it. The creeping triumph, the way doubt wormed into their harmony, tendrils of unease unfurling like night-blooming epiphytes upon the boughs of borrowed bliss, their perfume a mingled nectar of schadenfreude and sorrow. A fisherman approached, calling out for a mallet to mend his lines; Korban, fuming from the botched joint, tossed it his way with a flick of the wrist. The man caught it mid-air but recoiled at the touch, dropping it to the gravel as if scalded.

"Cursed hands today, eh? Keep it. I don't want that taint on my lines." He hurried past, muttering of broken *whakapapa*, the words floating back like the vents' hiss.

Aria set her brush down, frustration sharpening her features, born of that accumulating grit. The compounding of small failures. "It's the damp, maybe? Or the inks have gone off." But her voice wavered, and she glanced at Korban, their eyes meeting in a shared unease that pulled at something invisible between them.

Korban hammered a loose peg, the blow glancing off, sending sparks of wood flying. The joint held, barely, but the crack lingered, a fissure intimating of worse to come. Roimata withdrew deeper into the shadows as midday thunderheads rolled in, the fog lifting just enough to reveal the wharf's growing quiescence. Eyes averted, steps quickened.

The underground buzz thrummed on, a subterranean awakening stirring beneath the facades, syncing with the first fat drops of rain that pattered on the *pōhutukawa* leaves. Her palms burned, the itch a toll she welcomed, feeding the scar's old fire. The cords were rooted now, their warped patterns pulling at threads far beyond the soil. Human bonds parting like vines in an unseen tide, harmony fissuring into disarray.

## **Act II: The Necrotic Bloom**

### **Chapter 5: The Storm's Severance**

The sky over the inlet had thickened into a bruised canopy, thunderheads rolling in from the Tasman like an uninvited guest bearing grudges older than the loam beneath their feet. Vast, roiling architectures of cumuliform ire, adumbrating the unfeeling mechanics of atmospheric vastness, where tempests convene not from sentient wrath but from the blind alchemy of vapor and void, their shadowed underbellies veiling glimpses of a firmament as pitiless as the cosmic crucible that churns stars to ash.

Fog clung to the wharfside shed, turning the air into a palpable shroud that muffled the lap of waves against the pilings. Inside, the single lantern swung erratically from a rusted hook, casting jittery shadows across the cluttered workbench where Korban hunched over his latest commission. A *kōwhai* gate panel, its joints meant to interlock like the roots of an ancient *pōhutukawa*. But today, nothing fit. The wood shavings curled at his feet like discarded secrets. Every chisel strike sent a tremor through the grain, as if the timber itself recoiled.

Aria stood at the far end of the shed, her bronze hair tied back with a frayed strip of flax, sketching feverishly on a scrap of thick bark paper. Her inks had separated again, the pigments bleeding into muddy halos around the *kōwhaiwhai* spirals she had etched that morning. She wiped her fingers on her apron, leaving ochre streaks that matched the frustration etching lines around her eyes.

The geothermal vents outside hissed in irregular bursts, their steam, acrid with the smell of sulfur, curling through the cracks in the shed's walls like veins of ethereal corruption. "It's all damp again, Korbs. Warping the lot crooked," Aria said, her voice cutting through the patter of rain starting on the tin roof. She didn't look up from her page, but her stylus scratched harder, gouging the paper. "Pack it in till morning; the light's turned to rubbish."

Korban paused mid-strike, the chisel hovering. A bead of sweat. Or was it condensation? Traced down his temple. He had been at it for hours, ignoring the ache in his knuckles, the way his grip slipped just enough to nick the edge. He set the tool down with a clatter, the sound swallowed by a low rumble of thunder rolling in from the sea.

Aria's hand stilled. She glanced at him then, her gaze sharpening like a blade drawn from its sheath. Though beneath it, a shadow of her own unsaid grudge stirred, the memory of Korban's drifted nights echoing her father's long-ago vanishing into the inlet's churn, leaving her to weave alone from half-remembered patterns. "It's not the inks, Korbs. This place is eating at us. The fog, the shakes... it all goes wonky if you look too hard." She gestured vaguely at the panel, where a joint had split along the grain, exposing pale wood that seemed to weep sap in slow, reluctant beads.

From her vantage just beyond the shed's eaves, shrouded in the squall's first lashes, Roimata watched. She had come under pretense of borrowing twine for her herb bundles, but the storm had pinned her there, or so she told herself. Rain slicked her scarred hands, and she pressed closer to the *pōhutukawa's* gnarled trunk, its roots rutted tracks gleaming wet under lantern light from neighboring wharves. The gale tugged at her hood, but she didn't move.

In her mind's eye, she fed the discord: imagined Korban's hands not slipping from fatigue, but from the ghost of her touch, unresolved and festering. A spectral residue of caresses once fervent, now transmuted into the corrosion of memory, where the flesh's former ardor lingers as a voluptuous venom, etching latticed regrets upon the sinews of the present. Whispers of infidelity bloomed in her thoughts. His easy laugh with Aria, the way his shoulders relaxed around her like they never had for Roimata, evoking not mere betrayal but a ruinous inversion of intimacy's geometry: bonds once knotted in the loom of shared salt and sweat, now unraveling, their emergent voids adorned with the morbid splendor of what might have endured, beheld through the haze of an uncaring universe that devours all symmetries with equal, unflinching calm.

She projected it outward, willing the words to seep through the walls like the steam from the vents, those subterranean exhalations rising from the earth's viscera, bearing the subtle incense of buried intents.

Inside, Korban pushed back from the bench, his stool scraping against the warped floorboards. "Wonky? That's what you call it? My shavings are curling like they’ve got a mind to sabotage me, and your inks are running like tears from a bad dream. Maybe it's not the place, Aria. Maybe it's us." His voice rose, syncing with the thunder's growl, the shed's shutters rattling in protest as a gust battered the walls.

Aria straightened, tossing her stylus aside. It skittered across the bench, knocking into a vial of diluted ochre that she had mixed earlier from local clays. The vial teetered but held, its contents sloshing in a precarious spill that pooled, dark and gelid, staining the wood like a fresh bruise.

"Us? Or you, dragging in every old hurt like mud on your boots? I see you staring at the horizon some nights, Korbs. Like you're already halfway gone. Is that the 'us' you're on about?"

The words hung, heavier than the humid air. Korban's face flushed, the lantern light catching the veins in his neck. He grabbed the chisel, testing the joint again, but his fingers betrayed him. A sudden spasm: the blade shrieked off and gouged a thick splinter that flew like a shard of accusation. It embedded in the tabletop, quivering.

"Gone? After everything? Your patterns are erasing themselves overnight. Neighbors are starting to talk, you know. They call it 'broken lines'. We're poisoning the *whakapapa* just by breathing here."

Aria's laugh was sharp, brittle, lost in the wind's howl, brittle not just from the storm but from the hollow she had felt sketching those first *kōwhaiwhai* alone, after *whānau* gossip named her the mōhukihuki who bent too far, her patterns too loose to hold what the tides stole. "Broken lines? That's rich, coming from the man whose gates fall apart before they're even hung. Maybe it's your weave that's gone bad, Korbs. Or maybe it's mine. Ever think of that?"

She stepped closer, the space between them crackling like the air before lightning. In that moment, the shed felt smaller, the walls pressing in with the weight of unspoken doubts: his casual nights away on the boat, her quiet sketches of faces that weren't his. The curse's subtle weave tightened, invisible threads pulling at the frayed edges of their trust. Ethereal ligatures spun from the spite of distant hands, their tensile grace a mockery of ancestral cords, drawing lovers' harmonies into dissonant cadences of ornamental detritus of doubt, each emergent rift a splintering fracture upon the crystal of their shared illusion.

Outside, Roimata's breath quickened. She leaned into the gale, the rain stinging her cheeks like nettles. See it, she thought, her envy coiling tight. See how he looks at her, how she clings. Like it erases me. The projection sharpened: visions of stolen glances, of Aria’s hands on him in ways Roimata had only dreamed, tableaux vivants of tactile apostasy where flesh's fugitive ecstasies betray the soul's sequestered yearnings, their sensuous betrayals not crude defilements but ornate apostrophes to the ephemeral. Caresses scripted in the transient ink of skin and sigh, destined to fade into the abyssal archive of forgotten intimacies, where even the most ardent embraces dissolve into the corroding sediment of time.

Thunder cracked overhead, punctuating her malice, and she imagined it as approval, the storm's voice echoing her grudge. A celestial ratification of mortal pettiness, the tempest's tumultuous fury a veil upon the void's unblinking unconcern, where lightning's argent chisel etches ephemera upon the firmament's obsidian vault, only to efface them in the relentless rain.

Korban's hand slammed the bench, the impact sending the ochre vial toppling fully. It rolled off the edge and shattered against the floor in a grotesque hemorrhage of crimson-tinged shards, the liquid spreading in erratic deltas across the planks, seeping into the cracks like blood from a fresh wound. Vital ichor violated, its arterial wanderings a hieroglyph of rupture, pooling in sinuous tendrils that evoke the desecration of life's fleeting palette, where pigments once blended in harmonious alchemy now segregate into the mournful mosaics of severance, their glossy allure a poignant testament to entropy's aesthetic tyranny, beheld in the lantern's tremulous gaze as if through the fractured lens of a dying world's elegy. The color gleamed wetly, catching the lantern's flicker. Vitality spilled \- irreversible. "Damn it, Aria\! Look what you've…"

The words died in his throat, choked by the thunder's roar. Korban froze, the rage draining from his features like color from Aria's inks. He stared at the mess, the shards glinting like accusations in the gale's lash, then at Aria. Her eyes wide, reflecting the storm's fury back at him. Something fractured there, not with a sound, but with the quiet rend of a thread pulled too taut.

"This creeping sickness is poisoning everything I touch, Korban\!" Aria's voice was low, lethal, cut through with the grief she had buried under resolve. "You've turned our whole damn life to sludge. And I know where that poison came from\!"

Without another word, he snatched his jacket from the hook, the door banging open as he stormed out into the geothermal gales, his figure immediately blurring into the foggy night as rain swallowed him whole, the vents belching steam in mocking applause.

Aria stood alone in the shed's sudden silence, broken only by the relentless rattle of shutters and the drip of ochre into the widening pool. She knelt slowly, fingers brushing a shard. Sharp, unyielding. Drawing a thin line of blood that mingled with the stain. The pain was distant, overshadowed by the hollow ache in her chest. The place was eating at them, she realized, not with teeth, but with a patient erosion: joints failing, patterns fading, now this. Spilled life staining the floor like a curse made manifest.

And the eyes of the inlet, watching from the shadows, turned the personal rift into something larger, a breach in the shared weave of the community's life. An ontological fissure where intimate fractures propagate into the communal fabric, their subtle propagations an intimation of the cosmos's grand unraveling, where even the sturdiest tapestries of kinship and craft succumb to the inexorable attrition of time's unyielding loom, yielding not chaos but a melancholy splendor in the emergent patterns of loss.

She rose, wiping her hand on her apron, the blood streaking like an unintended tattoo. Thunder rolled again, distant now, as if the storm had expended its rage and moved on. But the gales lingered, howling through the cracks like a choral dirge, carrying subliminal echoes of suspicion into the night. Aria glanced toward the door, where Korban had vanished, and felt the first true chill. Not from the wind, but from the widening maw between them.

Through the rain-streaked window, she caught sight of the wharf beyond, its pilings groaning under the assault, slick and unforgiving, as if the inlet itself urged her to see: not all ruptures could be mended; some, she realized, spread silent and inexorable, like ink in water. Roimata slipped away then, melting into the underbrush as the rain thickened. Satisfaction curled in her gut, warm against the cold. Until a twinge at her wrist caught her, an itch like sundew slime clinging anew, sharper than before. She scratched absently, dismissing it as the storm's bite, and vanished into the squall.

Aria lingered in the shed, shutters rattling on, the spilled ochre drying into brittle testaments under the lantern's dying flicker. Outside, the grumblings of the night swelled, lanterns bobbing like judgmental stars: Tainted weave. Broken lines. Better keep it contained. The gale carried their insinuations toward the sea, where Korban trudged alone, fists clenched against the wind, unaware how the rift he had stormed through was already widening, pulling threads from the greater tapestry. A cataclysmic severance penned in the storm's aqueous calligraphy, where tempests' transient furies unveil the perennial tragedy of connection's fragility, bonds rent not by malice alone but by the inexorability of the abyss, their sundered filaments adrift in the gale's embrace like petals from a crimson canopy, exquisite in their fall, meaningless in the vast, unweeping sea.

### **Chapter 6: The Lagoon's Malevolent Lure**

The backways lay under a shroud of mist and geothermal steam, the narrow path a sluice of thick mud and discarded nets. Roimata moved through the humid miasma like smoke, her oilskin slicker brushing against the wet fronds that clung to her shoulders. The tempest had passed an hour prior, but the atmosphere remained heavy, nursing the storm's residual grudge.

She had timed it perfectly. Korban's spirit would be raw from the day's total severance, his temper still frayed from the final, bitter words with Aria. The boat joints he had cursed at the wharf popping loose like bad omens, and neighbors' sidelong glances sharpening into something colder. In her pocket, the wineskin sloshed softly, its contents a murky elixir of fermented *kumara* laced with the blight's deep tincture: *tōtara* sap, nightshade berries, sundew slime, blistering fungi, and shards of charred *mānuka* stick. Their flecks of charcoal and curled bark fragments steeped to bind the venom with a smoldering, ancestral bite. Capped by the corrupted twist of her inverted *karakia*.

She paused at the lagoon's fringe, where flax blades ringed the water like a tattered noose, drooping under the downpour. Sodden crates bobbed half-sunk along the shore, rusted chains draped over them like forgotten manacles, and methane bubbles rose lazily from the mire, popping with wet, hollow sighs that echoed the earth's quiet disgust.

With a hiss under her breath. Words pulled backward from the old chants, threads of *whakapapa* unraveled into bait. Roimata conjured the glamour, its ethereal lace-work unfurling like an incantation woven from the storm's own obscured vapors, transmuting the lagoon's squalid verge into a spectral parterre of deceptive allure: phantom lanterns flickering with an auroral gold that mocked the gray deluge, the illusion of a dry hollow cradled beneath the *pōhutukawa's* crimson-draped boughs, where one might slump into oblivion's silken embrace and forget the firmament's barbs, those infinitesimal thorns pricking at the flimsy integument of human pretense amid the churn of oceanic maelstrom. It shimmered into being like heat haze off the vents, a spectral allure that painted the lagoon's edge in deceptive warmth.

She perched the wineskin atop the crate, its strap of lurid, flayed leather. Gleaming just enough to snare the gaze like sundew's deceitful dew. Then, with a fluid unraveling, she dissolved into the *harakeke's* oblique shadows, those weary blades bowed in sullen obeisance, veiling her vendetta in gloom. Her heart thudded, not with fear, but with the sharp anticipation of the trap springing true.

This was the delivery, the vector she had brewed in the archive's dim corners. Korban's rage funneled into oblivion, his body the vessel for the curse's bloom. Vengeance for the mud splatters from his ute, beading like freshly etched spite, for the one-night stand he had abandoned years ago like driftwood washed clean. And deeper still, the tear in the ancestral weave, widened now to swallow his careless renewals whole. A ruinous rift where lineage's once-resilient cords disintegrate into ornamental detritus, their emergent voids an entropic intimation of the universe's grand unmaking.

Korban stumbled into view minutes later, his boots squelching through the muck, shoulders hunched against the tempestuous wind that whipped debris into his face. The argument with Aria still burned in his chest. The broken jar, the crimson ochre spraying like blood across the boat shed floor, her voice cracking on lethal mandates of his cursed hands ruining everything they touched. Wharf talk had dogged him all afternoon: tools vanishing, careless accidents, mutters of "taint in the lines" from the elders coiling ropes nearby.

He needed to be numb, just a swallow to dull the edges, something to chase away the phantom splinters under his nails from the splintering hulls. The glamour tugged at him subtly, bending the storm's howl into a siren's song, drawing his gaze to the crate's gleam. There it was: the wineskin, innocuous as flotsam, its strap glinting like an invitation. He snatched it up, uncorked it with clumsy fingers, and tilted it back.

The nectar hit like liquid fire, sweet at first. *Kumara's* fermented tang blooming on his tongue. Then twisting into something sharper, a burn that spread through his veins like roots seeking soil. Korban gasped, steadying himself against the crate, his mind already adrift. The world tilted, the flax fronds warping into threads that coiled visible in the steam rising from the mire.

Phantom cords, translucent and insistent, snagged at his wrists, tugging with the same inexorable pull as the inherited joining techniques his father had passed down. Dovetails that locked eternal, or so the stories went. But now, in the mist, he saw them fail: a hull he had half-built that morning splintering apart in his mind's eye, joints popping with dry cracks, wood curling back on itself like burning paper, each fracture a sinuous tracery of disintegration, where craft's once-luminous symmetries yield to the morbid elegance of entropy's cipher, beheld through the hallucinatory lens of a mind teetering on the precipice of irrelevance.

Distant shouts echoed from nowhere. "Cursed\! Cursed hands\!" The wharfies' voices warped into a chorus, their spectral lanterns bobbing on the far shore like wary eyes. The lagoon beckoned, its surface rippling under the rain, methane bubbles surfacing in clusters that burst with sighs too rhythmic, too knowing. Telluric respirations exhaled from the planet's somnolent viscera, their effervescent cadence a canticle intimating the earth's profound, uncaring vastness, where subterranean hymns compose elegies for surface follies in the blind symphony of geochemical depths.

Korban lurched forward, the wineskin's dregs spilling across his shirt, staining it dark. His boots sank into the shallows, the mire sucking greedy at his ankles, cold mud yielding like recoiling flesh. Visions swarmed thicker now: drowned flax fields stretching endless, their stalks woven into nets that ensnared phantom hulls, pulling them under. Labyrinthine tapestries of verdant desolation, where ancestral fibers transmute into snares of perdition, ensnaring not merely vessels but the very sinews of lineage in their inexorable descent, a baleful immersion wherein beauty's verdant splendor drowns in the detritus of oceanic oblivion.

He clawed at the air, fingers closing on nothing but vapor, the threads tightening around his limbs. Submerged snares yanking him deeper, intimating fractures in the bloodline, of bindings meant to hold *whānau* whole now frayed to let the void seep in. A bubble popped inches from his face, exhaling a sour gust that tasted of rot and stars long cooled, and Korban retched, doubling over as the lagoon's depths seemed to rise, lapping at his knees.

He staggered to a half-submerged piling, rusted iron biting into his palm as he slumped against it. The glamour held, veiling the squalor in corrupt haze. The crates now thrones of driftwood, the chains jeweled garlands. But the nectar's truth clawed through, unraveling the illusion thread by thread.

"Aria...?" he murmured, the name slipping out like a plea, her bronze hair flickering in the steam before dissolving into warped fronds. The great wind had died, leaving only the rich, fungal scent of wet soil, but it was the bubbles that chorused now, their pops syncing with the pulse in his temples, each one a hollow echo of the earth's violated sigh.

Roimata watched from her thicket, breath held shallow, the sodden hush concealing the tremor in her hands. This was it. The unmooring, his mind adrift in the tincture's delirium, inherited crafts disintegrating in hallucinatory proof of the curse's reach. Triumph should have flooded her, hot and vindicating. She saw the careless boatbuilder reduced to a muttering wreck, his pariah status etched permanently in the mud that clung to his face. The glamour had worked flawlessly, the wineskin her poisoned arrow straight to his core, deepening the *whakapapa* wound until it gaped wide enough for the abyss to drink deep.

Yet as Korban slumped, his face slack with visions she could almost trace in the mist. Flax fields drowning, hulls fracturing like brittle bones. A subdermal itch erupted on her forearm, just below the sleeve's cuff. It started. A prickle like nettles under skin, but swelled quickly: a raw, pulsing welt pushing through, its edges jagged as frayed cordage, mirroring the phantom threads coiling around him. A corporeal sigil of the curse's rebound, where spite's alchemical venom inscribes itself upon the flesh in grotesque welts, a stigmata evoking the reciprocity of malice.

Roimata scratched at it instinctively, nails drawing a bead of blood that the rain diluted pink, and the pain lanced sharp. The lesion throbbed in time with the bubbles' sighs, the vents' distant hiss rising in choral response. Her triumph soured in her throat, a fleeting doubt coiling tight in her chest like one of those spectral cords: what fairness might this be, the void's cruel paradox, her malice rebounding not as justice but as shared unmaking?

The glamour, fueled by the fevered air, flared then, momentarily illuminating Korban's form in stark relief. His chest heaving, eyes glassy with the nectar's grip. He stirred, murmuring Aria's name again, a ragged edge to it that tugged at Roimata's scars. Rage blinded him still, but the potion softened it to something pliable, a numb surrender to the lagoon's lure.

She stepped from the shadows, the glamour parting like mist for her approach, and in the nectar's haze, Korban's gaze latched onto her. Not as the scarred herbalist, but as Aria reborn. Bronze hair wet and clinging, eyes fierce with a treacherous light, her form curving inviting in the glamour-slicked light. His hand reached out, trembling, calluses rough against her palm as he pulled her down, the contact sparking. Fire meeting tinder, the pox's vector igniting through skin's defiled bridge, a tactile betrayal wherein flesh's fugitive ardors betray the soul's sequestered yearnings, their sensuous commingling not crude defilement but an ornate tribute to the ephemeral.

Roimata leaned in, her lips brushing his in a profane consummation born of malice, bodies entwining amid the debris as the heavy air, thick with the frantic, insectile whine of the swamp, settled around them. The act was fevered, urgent: his hands gripping her waist with desperate strength, hers guiding him deeper into the knee-deep shallows, the polluted mud yielding beneath them like a reluctant altar, churning thick and cloying around thighs and hips.

Waves of heat coursed through her, the lesion on her arm flaring brighter, but she pressed on, hissing inversions of the old bindings. Threads snapping in her mind's ear. As they moved together, slick and unrelenting, their mingled cries swallowed by the swamp's low, humid drone. Sweat and release spilled into the mire, bodily fluids swirling with the crimson-streaked water and filth, the mixture frothing like alchemical venom; this unholy commingling, seeping into the lagoon's polluted heart, transmuted into the toxin of mutual undoing. Tendrils of the curse blooming outward from their joined forms, the *whakapapa* tear widening to swallow them both in its gaping maw.

Afterward, they lay tangled in the mud, Korban's breaths ragged against her neck, the glamour fading to leave only the lagoon's squalor: crates groaning under the relentless sun, chains rattling like the ghost of severed anchors. He stirred once, eyes unfocused, then slipped into true oblivion, the potion's depths claiming him full. Roimata pulled away, the welt on her arm now a livid bloom, pulsing with the earth's sigh. The vents exhaling long and low, bubbles ceasing their chorus as if spent. Doubt lingered, but she shoved it down, slipping the empty wineskin into her pocket like a talisman. Roimata vanished into the flax, abandoning Korban in the mire's infected cradle without a backward glance.

### **Chapter 7: Whispers from the Fissure**

Korban stirred in the pre-dawn chill of the wharf shed, the air thick with the brine of low tide and the acrid tang of sulfur and rusting iron. His hand, callused from years of coaxing timber into seaworthy forms, brushed against his forearm as he reached for the lantern. A sharp itch flared beneath the skin, like a thread pulled too tight under worn cloth. He paused, the flame's flicker casting elongated shadows across the workbench cluttered with half-planed planks and coiled rope.

Rolling up his sleeve, he uncovered it: a lesion, raw and weeping, the size of a thumbnail, its edges puckered like a weld gone sour. Where flesh's once-resilient integument bloomed into a luxuriant welt of necrotic filigree. It hadn't been there yesterday. Or had it? The memory blurred, as if the fog outside had seeped into his thoughts. He wrapped it hastily in a rag stained with linseed oil, the fabric sticking with a wet suck that echoed the inlet's distant vents.

Routine, he told himself. Just another scar from the salt and the grind. But as he hefted the hammer, its weight felt off, leaden in his grip. An anvil awaited in his workshop, its surface scarred from generations of strikes. His father's before him, and his grandfather's before that, each blow a link in the chain of *whakapapa* that bound their hands to the sea's unforgiving rhythm. Korban swung, aiming for the chisel's edge to bite into the oak dowel, but the hammer glanced wide. A dull thunk reverberated, the metal skittering off the wood with a hollow ring that hung in the air like a missed heartbeat.

Sweat beaded on his brow. He swung again, muscles coiling with the desperate, familiar tension. But the tool felt like a treacherous stranger, slipping as if the void itself recoiled from his touch. The mortise joint for a hull's rib splintered loose with a dry crack, the half-built frame rupturing in his hands, shards scattered across the packed-earth floor.

The wharfies were already stirring outside, their boots thudding in the fog-hazed morning like muffled drums. One poked his head through the shed door, a burly man named Tamati with grease-streaked overalls and a pipe clenched in his teeth. "Oi, Korban, what's with all that racket? Sounds like you're fighting the bloody tide itself."

But as Tamati's gaze fell on the wreckage. The splintered wood, the scattered tools. His face tightened. His eyes dropped instantly to Korban's exposed right hand, where crimson deltas of infection had bloomed in an instant, mimicking the pattern beneath the rag. He stepped back, eyes flicking up to Korban's wrapped arm and then to his startled face. A horrified gasp came out of him: "Your hand..." Tools clattered as the others scattered, hauling their kits away, leaving the area empty save for the echo of retreating footsteps.

Korban stood frozen, the hammer dangling from his slack fingers, the welts pulsing with a warmth that matched the hollow ache in his chest. A visceral throb syncing with the vents' subterranean sighs.

By midday, the disquiet had fermented into outright shutdown. Korban trudged toward the communal forge at the wharf's heart, a low-roofed pavilion ringed by *pōhutukawa* whose crimson petals lay sodden in the lanes, trampled underfoot like discarded wards. He carried a salvaged plank under one arm, hoping for a second pair of eyes on the failing joint. Perhaps old Wiremu, whose knowledge of inherited techniques ran deeper than the inlet's silt.

But as he approached, the air shifted: conversations ceased, glances averted like touches withdrawn from a cooling ember. Children scattered from the edges, their chants rising sharp and insidious. "Pox hands\! Pox hands\!" As if the words were stones already flung. Elders gathered at the pavilion's threshold, their faces etched with the unyielding lines of taboo, arms crossed like barriers against a gathering storm.

Wiremu emerged first, his frame stooped but unyielding, the tā moko on his face a map of unbroken lines. "Korban," he said, voice gravelly as grinding gears, "you come seeking aid? Look at your hands. Tainted. That weave of yours, it's poisoned the line, broken the *whakapapa* clean through."

A wharfie. Younger, with the fire of preservation in his eyes. Stepped forward, refuse clutched in his fist: an apple core, flung with precision to splatter against Korban's chest. "Keep your rotten hands away. Your weave's been poisoned and broken\! Pox hands\!"

The chant swelled, a chorus of exclusion that drove Korban back, pelted now with peels and fish guts, the community's safeguard manifesting as visceral recoil. A cataclysmic severance decreed in the refuse's glutinous calligraphy, where communal bonds rent not by malice alone but by the occult inexorability of the gulf.

He retreated to the wharfside scraps, a derelict corner where rusted hulls leaned like forgotten ancestors, the lesions on his arm and hand flaring hotter, as if feeding on the sting of their scorn.

From her hiding spot amid the underbrush fringing the wharf. A tangle of flax and sundews that masked her voyeuristic vigil, close enough to catch the flung refuse's sour splatter and the chants' raw edge. Roimata watched it all.

Across the inlet, in the inked trestle of their shared shed, Aria slumped over her workbench, the vertigo hitting like the ferry's horn through fog. Low and throbbing, insistent as the pulse in her temples, a lingering echo of the night's fevered reconciliation where whispered apologies had dissolved into the salt-slick tangle of limbs and breath, their bodies yielding to the urgent rhythm of mended fractures, only for the dawn to reveal the insidious transfer woven into that fleeting communion.

The true horror settled on Aria. Not that she was sick, but that her mind was failing her, her own knowledge turning traitor. Her beloved *kōwhaiwhai* patterns. The intricate spirals of *whānau* continuity she had etched for years. Refused recall now; strokes erased mid-replication, bleeding into unintended blots on the parchment, dark blooms where ancestral motifs should have curled.

She gathered her pots. Ochre and indigo, their lids warped from damp. And tried to salvage a sketch for the market stall. Aria recoiled, the vertigo swirling anew, blame bubbling unspoken in her throat as she hunched over the ruined page once more, tracing a finger along the encroaching shadows that warped her spirals into voids.

The door creaked open then, Korban bursting through with the weight of the morning's defeat etched in the slump of his shoulders. "It's these damn shadows creeping in again... like the fog's seeped right into the lines, ruining everything," she muttered, half to herself but loud enough to carry on the still air, the words laced with a frustration born of the mounting failures.

"Shadows again? Always the same bloody excuse. Blaming the fog for every cock-up that slips through your fingers?" he snapped, his wrapped arm gesturing wildly at her ruined page, the rag around the lesion darkening with fresh weep.

Their embrace faltered there. His hand hovering hesitant before settling on her shoulder, the touch lingering cold and uncertain, as if the fissure between them emanated warnings neither could voice. Glances averted over dinner that evening, steam curling like retreating warmth, the air in the shed heavy with the weight of withdrawing intimacy.

Roimata filled her ledger in the archive's gloom later that afternoon, vignettes spilling from her pen: the hammer's hollow ring, the inks' unintended voids, the chants that emptied the lanes into wary silence. Fog-hazed mornings pressed against the grimed panes, the wharf sheds standing sentinel in the distance, their anvils mute.

She savored the atrophy. The lovers' bond twisting into shared decay, flesh echoing the rift she had torn in their continuity, symmetrical blights like blasphemous communion under the skin. But as she sketched a motif from memory. A *kōwhaiwhai* spiral that failed, mirroring her own scarred heart's shape. A flicker of doubt coiled in her chest, the venom of reprisal turning inward like a sundew's trap upon its own tendril.

Her hidden lesion throbbed then, subtle at first. The raw welt on her palm, pus weeping like failed welds, drawing an unwelcome scorn from within. It flared in response to their sorrow, the parallel bloom concretizing the escalation: consequences not just observed, but coiling back upon her, vanity's chill stirring beneath the glee. The air thickened with early decay's scent. Earthy rot mingling with exclusion's vacuum. Community lanterns dimming in the lanes like wards in retreat. Roimata closed the ledger, the hum souring faintly, the subtle recoil of the earth beneath her drawing her gaze toward the cold, uncaring resonance now taking root as the fissure thrummed on, confirming the terrible reciprocity of the Abyss.

### **Chapter 8: The Weeping Fronds of Exile**

The sleet came down in relentless sheets, turning the wharfside into a slurry of mud. Korban hunched against the rusted hull of an abandoned dinghy, his fingers. Once sure and callused from years of planing kauri planks. Now trembled as he rummaged through a sodden sack of tools. The lesions on his hand and forearm had burst open overnight, raw, puckered things that wept a thin, yellowish pus, staining the rag he had wrapped around it.

He winced as the salt-laced wind bit into the exposed flesh, each gust like needles pricking at frayed wiring. He had tried the forge that morning, shuffling up with his half-finished hull cradle under one arm, hoping for a sympathetic spark from the bellows or a loan of nails. But the elders had turned him away before he could even cross the threshold. Old Tane, his face etched like weathered driftwood, had planted himself in the doorway, arms crossed over his chest. "Your hands taint the old ways. Get out of here now\!" Tane had spat, his voice carrying over the hiss of the fire.

Undeterred by the elder's vitriol, Korban surged forward. The threshold yawned before him, a maw of ember-glow and soot-laiden shadows, promising the sacred clamor of hammer on anvil that might yet redeem his work. But Old Tane, that gnarled sentinel of forgotten rites, uncoiled with the sudden venom of a *taniwha* serpent roused from its torpor. His callused fist lashed out, not in measured rebuke but in a whirlwind of ancestral fury, catching Korban's jaw with the knotted force of storm-lashed roots.

The impact erupted crimson across Korban's vision, a fractal heresy of pain that unraveled his resolve into threads of bewildered vertigo. From the forge's crimson heart, Tane's bellows-brothers joined the fray. Hulking silhouettes etched in the forge's baleful nimbus, their faces masks of tribal umbrage, eyes hollowed by the ceaseless forge of communal edicts. They spilled forth like slag from a ruptured crucible, fists raised in choral condemnation, their roars a guttural litany against the interloper's audacity.

Korban reeled, the cradle tumbling from his grasp to splinter against the threshold's unyielding stone, its shards a mocking echo of his sundered ambitions. He fled then, not with the dignity of retreat but in the abject scramble of a soul pursued by the relentless machinery of exclusion, his boots churning the salt-crusted earth as the mob’s clamor swelled behind him. A rising fugue of communal contempt that tracked him like a fatalistic tide.

The chase wove through the village's labyrinthine fringes, where fronds wept tears of resin onto paths choked with the husks of offerings long forsaken by the gods. Korban's lungs burned with the acrid savor of his own desperation, each gasp a petition to the caprices that governed breath and betrayal. He veered into a thicket of exile's embrace. Thorned bushes whose branches interlaced in a gothic arabesque, their leaves a shroud of quivering umbra that muffled the baying of his hunters.

There, in the hollow of a colossal stump, its heartwood rotted to a sepulchral cavity veined with phosphorescent fungi, he crouched, willing his form to dissolve into the decay's bosom. His fingers. Trembling from the chase. Brushed the raw welt blooming on his jaw, tracing its ragged edge with an absent intimacy, the ghost of old nights flickering unbidden: salt-scented sheets, a woman's scarred tide he had once mapped without recoil, now inverted into this tainted sigil of his own unraveling.

The pursuers thundered past, their footfalls a seismic heresy against the stillness, voices fracturing the gloaming with oaths of ritual expulsion. Yet betrayal, that refined venom distilled from the alembic of kinship, found him unerringly. From the thicket's edge emerged Roimata, her form a treacherous silhouette against the bruised horizon, her eyes. Those orbs of obsidian. Now alight with the fanatic gleam of one who trades intimacy for the altar of conformity.

"There\!" she cried, her voice a lancet piercing the veil, finger extended like the accusing talon of some primordial arbiter. The mob pivoted as one, a hydra of vengeful sinew, converging upon the stump with the inexorable precision of entropy's decree. Korban burst from his sanctuary in a paroxysm of flailing limbs and guttural defiance, but the assault descended like a monsoon of corporeal indictment.

Fists rained upon him. Blunt sacraments of communal wrath that bruised flesh and loosened teeth, each blow a thesis upon his unworthiness, etching the grammar of ostracism into his quivering frame. He tasted the coppery sacrament of his own blood, felt ribs yield like the final stanzas of a crumbling epic. Yet in that crucible of agony, a feral calculus ignited: survival, not as heroism, but as the base arithmetic of evasion.

With a guttural invocation born of the rift’s own lexicon, Korban wrenched free, his body a comet of lacerations streaking toward the wilderness's maw. The mangroves parted before him in a frenzy of lashing fronds, their weeping sap anointing his flight with a balm of bitter irony. Behind, the pursuers faltered, their zeal guttering against the encroaching dusk. The fronds' susurrus a mournful dirge that sighed of futility, of exertions expended upon a pariah. One by one, they peeled away, shadows retreating to the forge's hearth, leaving Korban to the wilderness's vast, unblinking vigil: a solitary theorem adrift in the equation of exile, where beauty's fleeting architectures dissolved into the void's eternal, uncaring sum.

Inside the shed, Aria moved slowly through the dim clutter of her work area, the air thick with the metallic tang of spilled ochre and the underlying rot of decay. Her hands, usually steady as she etched *kōwhaiwhai* spirals into pendants or vellum, now shook as she folded sketches into an antique satchel. The patterns she had loved. The interlocking curves symbolizing *whānau* bonds, the flowing lines of ancestral rivers. Slipped from her mind like sand through fingers. She tried to trace one now, on a scrap of driftwood salvaged from the wharf: a simple fern frond motif, protective and eternal.

But the ink bled outward, forming dark voids that swallowed the edges. Her needle hovered over her emerging lesion, just below her collarbone. A raised, veined thing that twisted under her touch like a living glyph. Vertigo washed over her again, the room tilting as if the floor were the deck of a storm-tossed boat. "These lines... they're smudging to buggery," she muttered to herself, her voice a threadbare whisper. "Can't keep the pattern straight anymore. Time to pack it and go, before they stone us in the street."

She glanced at the warped pendant Korban had carved for her in happier times, its *pōhutukawa* grain now marred by tiny cracks, as if the wood mourned its maker. With trembling fingers, she tucked it into the satchel alongside the ochre pots. Three plastic vials, their contents congealing like old blood. And the last of her sketches, rolled tight against the penetrating moisture. Tears streaked her face, hot and salt-slick, mingling with the sleet that drummed on the tin roof.

She sank onto a crate, the satchel clutched to her chest, phantom pains lancing through her limbs as if Korban's decay seeped through the walls. The underground buzz hummed subsonically beneath the floorboards, a subtle vibration that set her teeth on edge. Resolve hardened in her gut, cold and unyielding: she couldn’t stay, not with the lines erasing themselves, the bonds fraying like ghostly vestiges on the driftwood in her lap.

The reality of the Abyss had finally made the Veil unbearable. Past vibrancy overwritten, neighbors' eyes averted like breaths fogging cold glass. She stood, slinging the satchel over her shoulder, and pushed open the shed door just enough to let in the gray light. The fronds overhead drooped lower.

Memories flooded then, unbidden but insistent: a half-forgotten afternoon in her aunt's house, deep in the fern-choked hinterland where the geothermal seep carried a lingering, sulfurous drift, like the earth's own hymned *karakia*. Her aunt. Silver-braided and unyielding, her arms a living gallery of *kōwhaiwhai* etched in defiant spirals. Had pulled Aria aside after a weaving lesson gone awry, the flax resisting her novice plaits like a warning from the *rito* itself.

"*Whakapapa* isn't rigid, *e mōhukihuki*," her aunt had said, voice low as the vents' distant sigh, guiding Aria's fingers over a scarred remnant of *harakeke*, its central strip frayed but unbroken. "It's adaptive. Bends to threats, inverts to contain them. See here? When the weave tears from without, you don't mend straight; you mirror the rupture, twist the pattern inward like a *koru* recoiling on itself."

Roimata's laughter died in her throat as she caught sight of Aria emerging, gaunt and tear-streaked. Triumph soured to gall, a burn rising in her chest. Her lesion flared, vicious and unbidden, the skin splitting further with a wet pop that echoed the fronds' drip. Pain shot through her, visceral and intimate, as if Aria's genuine sorrow had grafted itself onto her own flesh. A mirror of abjection she hadn't bargained for. Her malice, once a sharp knot of spite, felt ephemeral now, as fleeting as the petals shedding from the *pōhutukawa* in the wind.

The bazaar clamor resumed around her, unconcerned as ever. Vendors hawking smoked eel, their calls thinning into the rising wind, laughter cutting through the sleet like knives dulled by the thickening gusts. Community lanterns flickered and dimmed along the barred paths, extinguishing one by one like severed ties snuffed by an oncoming howl. Roimata rose, ledger snapping shut, and edged closer to the shed, the fronds' weeping turning to frantic lashes against her skin, their crimson tips stinging like barbs in the quickening draft. Subtle rumbles stirred beneath the ground, swelling now into a geothermal tremor that rattled the air, hinting at reckonings yet to crest. And for the first time, her voyeur's perch felt less like a throne and more like the lip of an indifferent grave, as the inlet's fevered depths coiled a gale, ready to erupt, confirming her place not as puppet master, but as a victim caught in the Nether's relentless recoil.

## **Act III: The Mechanic Lullaby**

### **Chapter 9: The Rift's Reckoning in Crimson**

The door of the boat shed creaked wider under Aria's push, gray light spilling in like diluted ash, but the world beyond had twisted in the moments of her hesitation. What had been a sullen drizzle moments before erupted into a geothermal gale, a howling fury born from the inlet's fevered depths. Steam vents belching upward in ragged plumes that scalded the air with sulfur's acrid perfume and the metallic bite of unearthed bile, each exhalation a chthonic sigh unveiling the earth's relentless wrath, where subterranean furies coil like forgotten leviathans stirring beneath the turbid veil of vulnerable symmetries.

The gale shoved back against the door, forcing it half-shut before she could step through, fronds from the encroaching underbrush whipping across the threshold like vengeful serpents, their lashes a flailing of verdant fury that etched fleeting tapestries of pain upon the air, crimson petals from the *pōhutukawa* tree pelted the frame in frantic spirals, adhering wetly to the wood as if beseeching entry into the shadowed sanctum, harbingers of a beauty doomed to effloresce in the storm's inexorable embrace.

Aria braced against the frame, satchel slung heavy over her shoulder, the weight of her sketches and pots pulling at her like an anchor in the storm's undertow. The underground buzz intensified beneath the floorboards, a vibration that thrummed up through her boots, syncing with the thunderous rumble from the fissures below. Her blight-marks itched fiercely now, the welts on her arms pulsing in time with the wind's assault, amber fluid seeping through the cloth she had bound them with. Resolve flickered. Cold, unyielding. But the gale's roar drowned her inner steel, turning it to a fragile echo.

Then, through the steam-shrouded chaos, a figure staggered into view: Korban, hurled forward by the storm's caprice, his form a ruinous effigy of communal decree and elemental scourge. He crashed against the door's edge, one hand clawing the jamb for purchase, the other clutching his side where fresh welts bloomed like accusations under his sodden shirt. Compounded now by the forge's brutal imprimatur, bruises swelling in livid constellations across his ribs, a laceration above his brow weeping rivulets of blood that mingled with the rain in crimson tributaries, tracing the contours of his battered visage like runic scars.

His jaw hung slack, discolored and swollen from Tane's knotted benediction, each labored swallow eliciting a grimace that fractured his features into a mosaic of agony. Rain lashed his face in sheets, matting his hair into dark, dripping coils that clung to gashes on his scalp, and his breath emerged in ragged bursts, each exhale laced with rising steam as if the earth's heat had claimed his lungs, while flecks of blood flecked his lips from ribs that protested every inhalation with the creak of splintered bulwarks. His eyes. Wild, fever-glazed, rimmed with the purpled bloom of orbital contusions. Locked on her through the half-open gap, recognition sharpening into something raw and desperate, a plea etched in the bruised lexicon of the forsaken.

"Korban\!" The shout tore from her, half-lost to the howl, mangled by the swelling that thickened his tongue, as he forced his way inside, his movements a halting choreography of defiance and debilitation. The door banged shut behind him with a splintering crack, but the gale's fingers clawed through every seam, rattling shutters and sending drafts swirling around the workbench like inquisitive ghosts. Petals skittered across the floor in his wake, slicked now with the sanguine droplets that trailed from his wounds. The air thickened with ozone and rot, the vents below hissing in complaint as if scorched by the intrusion, their subterranean chorus mocking his arrival.

She stumbled back a step, the satchel's strap biting into her shoulder, heart hammering against her ribs. The lantern swung wildly overhead, casting erratic shadows that danced across his mottled skin. Reddened patches flaring brighter under the sleeves, mirroring her own decay, but overlaid now with the forge's fresco of violence: hematomas purpling his collarbone like necrotic orchids, abrasions on his knuckles weeping in sympathy with the lesions that already gnawed at his flesh, the whole of him a palimpsest where betrayal's ink bled into the rot's inexhaustible archive.

"Korban? What the. Get out\! I was leaving, you bastard. This isn't—" Her words fractured, voice cracking under the weight of exhaustion and the storm's choral fury. But fury of her own ignited, banked embers flaring to life, and now it lashed out unchecked, her gaze recoiling from the spectacle of his desecration as if it were contagion incarnate.

He lurched forward, collapsing one hip against the workbench for support, the impact jarring a hiss of pain from his bruised ribs that echoed like a fractured incantation. His gaze bored into her, fever twisting his features into a mask of unraveling, the swelling around his eye lending his stare a cyclopean asymmetry.

"The lagoon... Aria, it wasn't me, not all of it. The water pulled me under, dragging like weeds. I couldn't... , the rot started there, seeping back. I brought it home to you." The confession spilled out in fevered fragments, syncing with the gale's rhythmic battering, each gust underscoring his words like punctuation from the relentless earth, his voice a gravelly rasp undercut by the wet suck of blood in his throat. Lesions on his neck throbbed visibly, the skin around them puckering as if the void approved the breach.

Aria's recoil was instinctive, a stool scraping back against the protesting floor. The air hung heavy now, laced with the sour tang of their shared affliction, steam curling from his clothes to mingle with the lantern's haze and the coppery reek of his blood. She thrust out her arm, yanking back the sleeve to bare the welts. Glistening, tacky under the flickering light, patterns of old *kōwhaiwhai* feathering away like erased vows.

"Your mess from screwing around behind my back, you cheating bastard? This creeping shit. Some venereal curse you picked up from whatever slut you've been sleeping with. It's all over me now, erasing everything I touch? You brought it home, Korbs. Ruined our whole damn life\!" The accusation flew sharp, laced with the grief she had buried under resolve, her voice rising to a venomous crescendo that cut through the storm's din, dismissing his wild tale of waves and weeds as just another lie to cover his tracks, her eyes flicking involuntarily to the bruises blooming like fungal venomous spores across his battered frame.

Outside, *pōhutukawa* branches lashed the wall in escalating frenzy, their whipping cadence a tactile dirge that amplified her rage, the vents' hiss rising to a near-scream. Desperation fueled his next move. A lunge across the narrow space, fingers outstretched to grasp her wrist, to pull her back from the precipice, but the forge's legacy betrayed him utterly: a bruised knee buckled under the strain, compounded by the fever's insidious tide, sending him slamming into the bench.

Vents below recoiled with a guttural belch, steam jetting up through the fissures in scalding retaliation, singeing the air with the scent of scorched earth and cauterized flesh. Aria twisted free in the chaos, snatching her satchel by the strap, swinging like a pendulum of finality.

"No. I'm done. This rift, it's swallowing us whole. Stay in your muck; I'm gone." Her voice sliced through the melee, tear-streaked but iron-clad, the words a severance etched deeper than any needle. She wrenched the door open against the gale's resistance, fronds clawing at her like reluctant mourners as she plunged into the storm.

The earth's roar enveloped her, a guttural hymn that buried Korban's hoarse pleas. "Aria, wait, please don't leave me\!" Beneath layers of wind and rain, his cry ragged with the pain of ribs that flexed like fractured reeds. He slumped against the bench, the shed shuddering in sympathetic defeat, petals scattering like shattered wards across the widening void between them.

The tempest bore Aria inland through a gauntlet of fern-choked paths, wind-whipped branches snagging at her clothes and soughing of hollows yet unplumbed. Hours dissolved into a blur of stinging resolve, the satchel a sodden burden against her hip, until the hinterland house materialized. A squat silhouette in a moss-draped hollow, its eaves carved with heirloom whorls that watched like silent sentinels.

The ground beneath the structure felt oddly alive. A thin, brittle crust over a cauldron of steam and churning rock. Each of Aria's labored steps across the yard made the earth resonate with a low, drum-like hollow sound, a constant reminder that the Veil of solid land here was only inches thick, precarious and provisional. Geothermal seep lingered in the air here, a faint acrid undernote to the damp earthiness, vents exhaling distantly as if the inlet's presence had followed her here.

She shouldered through the door, kin materializing from the dim interiors: a cousin with arms corded from years of felling kauri, an aunt whose silvered braids swayed with the quiet authority of unbroken lines. Their greetings warmed the chill clinging to her skin. Expressions of "*Kia ora, whānau*" laced with concern. But Aria's lesions burned beneath her sleeves, the cloth adhering with a tacky reluctance that betrayed her hidden rot.

"Eh, Aria. Your patterns always stitch us right. Ink me up, cuz? Something to hold the *whānau* close." The cousin's grin pulled her toward the scarred table in the nook, where a single bulb hummed overhead, casting pools of light on the arrayed inks like reluctant talismans. She complied with mechanical nods, binding her arms tighter under long sleeves, the drag of fabric a constant, itching reminder.

The house settled in anticipation, carvings in the walls seeming to lean in, expectant. Before the needle's first descent, Aria invoked the *karakia*. Words for ancestral binding, threads of *whakapapa* invoked to seal the weave. Her voice trembled slightly, the chant weaving through the air like wispish flax: protections against fray, continuities unbroken. But midway, a dissonance crept in. A subtle buzz, echoing the flax's ancient rip, the air thickening as if the invocation snagged on invisible barbs. The carvings dimmed imperceptibly, fibers in the walls complaining with a sodden creak.

The cousin bared his forearm, the *kōwhaiwhai* emerging under her hand: spirals of life's endless coil, inked with deliberate strokes meant to echo resilience. The aunt followed, shoulder exposed for knots interlocking like familial vows. Yet the lines twisted unnaturally swiftly. Coiling tighter, inward, like snares sprung too soon. Beads of sweat pearled wrong on her kin's skin, iridescent and clinging, the patterns reddening at the edges.

Aria's hand faltered on the third mark, needle poised as the intimation uncoiled in her core: a gnawing horror surfacing like bile. The *karakia* had backfired, words inverting through the breach. *Whakapapa's* tear, ripped open by the curse's roots, channeling her tainted ink as an accelerator. What she had meant as a bridge now vectored the blight deeper into her family, bonds fractalizing into decay's eager conduits.

"It's... the chant rebounded. The patterns are snares now. My ink's the poison, pulling through the break in the line... faster, because of us." The realization escaped in a horrified hush, the house trembling as distant vents roared in choral outrage, foundations quaking under the weight of the revelation. A cataclysmic gnosis wherein the architecture of lineage crumbles into the relentless void, ancestral *karakia* recoiling like wilted leaves upon the necrotic loom of entropy, their emergent welts a testament to beauty's wretched effacement.

### **Chapter 10: The Crimson’ Abyssal Recurrence**

The inlet had turned its face to winter's edge, the *pōhutukawa* trees along the fringe shedding the dried crimson remnants of their summer blooms in reluctant drifts, as if the branches themselves mourned the season's inexorable turn. A wondrous efflorescence of crimson arabesques drifting into the muddied quiet amid the geochemical dirge of an uncaring shore. Drizzle pattered against the wharf's weathered planks, turning the air sharp and metallic, while the geothermal vents below hissed their impassive steam, carrying currents of putrescent miasma on the wind.

Roimata trudged through the bazaar, her boots caked with the same gritty mud that coated everything here. Wharf-trod grit laced with the subtle residue of shared lives, shared infections. She pulled her coat tighter, but the chill seeped deeper, a familiar itch blooming beneath her sleeve, like threads pulling loose at the skin's seam. A lone fisherman hunched against the rail of a battered boat, his once-sturdy frame now gaunt and shadowed under a hood, right at the bazaar's wharfside fringe where stalls butted against the tide. Lesions mottled his hands, fine crimson deltas creeping up his knuckles like poorly healed tattoos. He clutched a handful of coins, pleading with a passing vendor whose face was half-hidden in a scarf.

"Just a bit longer on the mooring fee. Swear it'll be sorted by dawn," he muttered, voice raw as the wind. The vendor hesitated, then dropped a coin into his palm, their fingers brushing in that brief, unwitting exchange.

Roimata paused amid the nearby stalls, her breath catching as a dried crimson remnant was stripped from the branches, sticking to the wet wood like a bloodied seal. A sigil of contagion's ornate emblem, where fleeting symmetries of flesh yield to the seepage of entropy's veiled jest. A sudden gust off the water tugged at her scarf, carrying an acrid tang from the wharf. She turned away, but the itch followed her, a quiet insistence that drew her steps toward the old paths.

The family's blight had rippled out in waves: a cousin at the edge of the *whānau* web, his arm itching where the *kōwhaiwhai* pattern Aria had inked last summer now twisted insidiously, branches curling inward like secrets turned sour. No one spoke of it openly, but the shared glances at gatherings carried the weight. A single muted echo, capped before it could sprawl into a communal taint. Roimata felt it in the wind's tainted breath, spore-fragments catching in her throat like ash from a distant fire, carried on family-seeded gusts that knew no borders.

Her glee from months ago had soured long ago, curdling into a gall that sat heavy in her gut. But today, as she passed a cluster of hikers bundled against the sleet. Their laughter bright and unscarred, hands linked in easy idyll. A dim flicker reignited in her chest. Envy, that old worm, uncoiled just enough to sting. It laced with the insistent itch on her skin, compelling her forward through fevered ravings in her mind, half-remembered paths unfurling like a map drawn in delirium. She needed to see it up close now, the toll of her malice etched in flesh she could no longer ignore.

The boat shed where Aria had once made her home called to her, a sagging relic half-swallowed by the underbrush, its walls furred with moss and the ghosts of better days. The *pōhutukawa* loomed beside it, roots gripping the earth where she had buried those cursed knots seasons ago, its stark, gnarled branches clawing the cold air. Roimata pushed the door open, hinges groaning like a reluctant confession. Inside, the air hung thick and stale, laced with the damp rot of abandonment. She sank onto the threadbare mattress in the corner, the one Aria had once draped with sketches, and rolled up her sleeve.

The flaring lesion traced a subtle line across her wrist, welts rising like the ghost of a weave pulled apart. Her fingers hovered over it, tracing the edges with a touch that was half-revulsion, half-yearning. "The thread is broken," she hissed, "and the venom is mine." The itch had become a pull, a morbid fascination twisting her grudge into something sharper. A need to measure what she had wrought, to witness the pure decay she had sown.

The door creaked again, and Aria stepped through, a wraith in the dim light. Exile had carved her hollow: skin stretched taut over bones that jutted like the inlet's exposed roots, breaths coming ragged and fever-hot, sweat beading on her brow despite the chill. Her bronze hair hung limp, matted against her neck, and the lesions bloomed vivid across her arms and throat. Crimson patterns that mocked the *kōwhaiwhai* she had once drawn with such fluid grace, withered scrim, the morbid elegance of blight's playbook.

She leaned against the frame, one hand clutching the jamb for support, her steps labored as if each one dragged against the rot's voracious pull. But her eyes. Those held a glint of something deliberate, a spark amid the ruin. This was her choice, etched in the lines of her suffering: a conscious agony, a last grasp at containing the nihilism that clawed inward.

The air in the shed seemed to compress, thick with the sulfurous breath of the vents. Roimata rose slowly, her limbs heavy with the haze settling in her veins, feeling less like a woman and more like an element in a fatal equation finally balancing. The subterranean hum swelled beneath her feet, a low, apathetic thrum that was not a warning, but a final overture to the dissolution of human agency.

"Show me," she said, fever-slurring the words as she extended her palm in a mesmerized drift. "What I've made of you. Let it mark me too. The beauty I broke, come home to bite. This is not penance, Aria; this is the final geometry."

Aria’s gaze locked on hers, steam-hissed breath steadying into a laboured rhythm. Her approach was an agonizing traverse of the room. The floorboards groaned under her sudden, sinking weight as she fell to her knees before Roimata. Up close, the infection was a grotesque tableau. The lesions oozed a lurid fluid, fever-hot and iridescently slick, which spun between her blighted fingers like malignant filaments of unmade silk.

"May your lines tangle like mine, your patterns bleed into nothing," Aria hissed... "the smudge that binds, the pattern that unravels us both." She paused, fingers hovering over her weeping sore as if anointing a treacherous relic, then dipped them deliberately into the lesion's ooze, drawing out the dark, adhesive ink in a slow, agonizing pull. The fluid gleamed wetly, clinging to her skin like a reluctant vow.

Roimata's breath hitched, the air thickening as if the shed itself recoiled. Her subconscious craving. Once a seething envy for this woman's artistry, now resurfaced as a fever-dream echo of the beauty she had sought to destroy. Overrode the last threads of defiance. She held her palm steady, the skin prickling in anticipation, allowing the etch as inevitable closure. Aria's fingers met her flesh, smearing and dragging the lesion-ink in inverted curls that mirrored the flax weave Roimata had torn apart, the touch searing like a lover's reluctant claw.

Fibers seemed to protest beneath the skin, a subtle tremor as ancestral patterns perverted into binding scars. *Kōwhaiwhai* twisted into counterlore, weaponizing the *whānau's* broken lineage against the curse's origin amid the inlet's vast, sedimentary indifference.

Outside, as if in mechanistic parody, a geothermal vent belched a guttural snap. Its steam-curl uncoiling in lazy synchrony with the drag of Aria's infected stroke. The *pōhutukawa's* gnarled roots creaked a low, arthritic groan, twigs clawing in flurries that pattered against the eaves. A muffled dirge intimating the earth's profound, uncaring vastness, where personal rites propagate into dissonances, spite's lash a perfume upon the air.

The *pōhutukawa* tree, stark and skeletal, shook its gnarled branches, and the final few necrotic remnants of its crimson blooms scattered softly against the mossy nave of the inlet's fringe, filaments dripping in futile rebellion as the sleet turned to a choral sigh. The "buzz". Those subterranean hints of underthrum. Swelled now into the universe's mechanistic lullaby, a shroud that wrapped the shed like the earth's unyielding arms.

Roimata's thoughts drifted in the recurrence, adrift in the exquisite lie of agency, dissolving into the void's serene indifference. Her flax knots, Aria's tattooed *whānau*. Futile defiances, all of them, merely accelerating the sublime unmaking, compounding cultural debt as cosmic interest. Sown malice: A negligible accelerant in the void's jest, her envy and Aria's rite twin motes caught in the same relentless tide. Human values of binding and beauty, local illusions unravelling against the cosmos's relativistic matrix.

The focus held intimate, the family's residual echo capped in the wind's dying whisper. Aria slumped back, spent. Her breaths evening into an exhausted rhythm as the etching sealed its bid for containment. Roimata cradled her marked palm, the lines already fading into the skin's inevitable fade, and let the fever pull her under. The inlet churned on, geothermal vents hissing their acrid dirge, and entropy's dark weave secured its hold eternal in the mute oblivion of the bloom.

The End.
