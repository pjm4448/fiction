# The Curator of Vectors: A Jagged Meal

**Synopsis**

Arthur Penhaligon, a timid file clerk trapped in the suffocating grey monotony of 1960s office drudgery, inherits a decaying Victorian house from his great-uncle Silas, a reclusive eccentric who researched impossible geometries and dimensional perception. Inside the house, Arthur discovers a network of grotesque brass and quartz machines: chromatic lenses in the turret that reveal hidden patterns of reality, an olfactory distillation device that condenses pure emotional essence, and a synthesis chair embedded in calcified root-matter that promises ultimate clarity. As Arthur experiments with these devices, he experiences intoxicating glimpses of cosmic logic where human morality becomes irrelevant and the grey world reveals itself as a protective barrier against something vast and hungry. When workplace humiliation drives him to use the machines against his tormentor, Arthur discovers the devices feed on human suffering and operate through a sentient orchid that acts as both spy and conduit. Realizing the house is a living entity that digests consciousness and threatens to consume the entire city, Arthur makes a desperate gamble to become a node of resistance by willingly sacrificing himself to the synthesis chair, hoping his conscious agony will poison the system from within.

The colour grey wasn't merely a visual component of Arthur Penhaligon's existence; it was the ashen veil through which he moved, breathed, and slowly suffocated. Linoleum floors sticky with decades of indifferent mopping. Metal desks scarred with the ghosts of forgotten paperwork. Even the air in the offices of Consolidated Mercantile Holdings seemed composed of static, thick with the dust of ledgers and the stale exhalations of petty resentments.

Arthur Penhaligon, filer fourth-class, was himself a creature of this pallor. Thinning hair combed meticulously over a scalp the colour of parchment. Eyes that rarely met another's gaze. His mother had often whispered that the Penhaligon blood was "porous," prone to letting the wrong kind of light in. As a child, he'd assumed she meant mental illness. He remembered staring at the sun until his retinas burned, seeing not white light, but a bleeding, impossible spectrum that seemed to leak from the sky itself like ichor from a wound. He had learned to squint, to dim the world to survive. Now, at thirty-seven, feeling the weight of a genetic melancholy he couldn't shake, he realized she hadn't been speaking metaphorically. She had been speaking of exposure, of contamination.

His only rebellion against this monochrome existence was a single, delicate *Phalaenopsis* orchid he kept on the windowsill. It wasn't a hobby; it was a deliberate laceration. A violet bruise in a sea of slate that he tended with the desperate devotion of a prisoner hiding a shiv. He watered it with distilled water, unaware that he was tending to a sentry, nurturing a spy in his midst.

Arthur sat at his desk, staring at the spreadsheet until the numbers began to blur and writhe. A shadow fell across his work. The smell hit him first: cheap musk and stale tobacco, the reek of casual cruelty.

"Oops. Careful there, Artie."

The hot liquid splashed over Arthur's knuckles. Coffee, scalding and black, soaking into the Q3 reports like bile into tissue. Gregson stood there, mug tilted, a feigned look of shock plastered over a grin that didn't reach his eyes.

"Hand slipped," Gregson said, not offering a napkin. "You really should organize your desk better, mate. Fire hazard."

Arthur's throat constricted. He wanted to scream, to overturn the desk, to claw at Gregson's smug face. Instead, he grabbed a tissue. "It's... it's fine, Barry. I can re-print it."

Across the room, their supervisor, Mr. Henderson, glanced up, sighed, and looked back down. *He sees,* Arthur thought, the burn on his hand throbbing in time with his pulse. *He sees, but in this world, seeing changes nothing. Seeing is merely witnessing the machinery of degradation.*

The letter arrived on a Tuesday. Thick, creamy paper from "Messrs. Algernon, Croft & Abernathy."

The legalese was dense, but the gist was clear: His great-uncle, Silas Penhaligon, had passed away. Arthur was named as the sole beneficiary. Silas, the "black sheep" who lived in the decaying part of the city, in streets where the lamps flickered with diseased light, casting a sickly topaz glow over crumbling facades. *The porous blood,* his mother's voice whispered from memory's crypt. *Silas tore the veil.*

Mr. Abernathy, a lawyer who looked like he'd been preserved in formaldehyde, handed Arthur a heavy brass key. "Your great-uncle was... specific. He insisted the inheritance go to a blood relative of the 'correct temperament.' Someone properly emptied by life." The lawyer's smile was a bloodless thing, his teeth the dull color of old ivory.

The house on Blackwood Street did not merely stand. It crouched, its gabled roof a ribcage, the narrow turret rising like a blind, lidless eye. Mortar bled between the bricks in pale, powdery streaks, as if the building had been sweating for decades, secreting some slow metabolic waste. When Arthur inserted the brass key, the lock clicked with a heavy, final thud: the sound of a coffin lid sealing. The door opened inward with the slow reluctance of a great stone moving deep underground.

Inside, the air was stagnant: thick, humid, tasting faintly of copper and overripe fruit. The foyer was silent, yet the floorboards felt unnaturally warm underfoot, the heat rising directly from the glandular machinery operating in the dark below. He could smell it, the faint, oily scent of extraction seeping up through the cracks like digestive juices. The house was already digesting.

Arthur moved deeper. The ground floor rooms were arranged like chambers of a dormant machine: the parlor (where the mantelpiece waited like an altar, its marble veined with what looked like malachite deposits), the dining room whose long table had fused to the floor with fungal brass growths, and the kitchen where copper pipes had burst through plaster like veins seeking air, like blood vessels rupturing through necrotic skin, oxidized to a verdigris patina that resembled diseased jade.

He glanced upward. A narrow staircase spiraled upward, its banister carved into interlocking tentacles that seemed to writhe in his peripheral vision. But above that, near the ceiling, he glimpsed a dark, calcified knot. A tunnel of hardened root-matter seemed to have grown through the plaster like a tumor, leading to an attic that shouldn't exist according to any architectural logic. It looked ancient, festering, and waiting with the patience of a trap-door spider.

Below, a second staircase descended into the cellar, exhaling cold, meat-locker breath that carried the promise of preservation and rot.

Only the study, Silas's study, felt like a room at all.

Silas's journals were not on the desk; they were embedded in the walls, pages fused into the plaster like fossilized neurons, like memories calcified into the very bones of the house. Arthur had to peel them free, the wall bleeding a pale sap where the binding tore away, leaving wounds that wept a substance with the viscosity of liquid amber.

He read three entries before the book slipped from his fingers. As his eyes tracked the spidery script, a sharp, needle-like pain pricked the back of his optic nerve, a sudden, involuntary psychic feedback loop that tasted of copper and rot.

*"17 Oct 1948: The Curator waits. It exists in a famine of sensation. We, with our porous blood, are the only ones who can bridge the gap between dimensions of perception."*

*"3 Mar 1957: I have built the straw. It is not a smell; it is the distillation of absence itself."*

*"12 Nov 1972: It is not enough to simply observe. One must provide. One must feed the hunger that lies beneath all geometry."*

That was enough. Arthur resolved to sell everything, to flee this inheritance of madness. He turned to the door, hand reaching for the brass knob. It wouldn't turn. It was searing hot, blistering his palm. He pulled, but the doorframe held fast, the wood swollen tight against the jamb like tissue sealing a wound.

A sudden, overwhelming thrum emanated from the parlor, specifically from the *Phalaenopsis*. He had brought it with him in a foolish, sentimental attempt to domesticate the gloom, but now he regretted it with the force of a man who has swallowed poison. The sound wasn't auditory; it was a paralyzing frequency that locked his joints, a transmission channeled directly through the lenses in the turret above, broadcasting distortion into his blood like a radio signal hijacking his nervous system. It drilled into him, a command that bypassed his will. He couldn't leave. The house hadn't just invited him in; it had trapped him like an insect in amber.

Arthur took two days off work. He visited Dr. Evans, a weary GP with cold hands and colder eyes.

"Tinnitus," the doctor said, shining a light into Arthur's ear. Then he paused. He frowned, leaning closer, moving the light back and forth. "That's... odd."

"What is?"

The doctor didn't answer immediately. He clicked the penlight on and off three times, each time leaning closer, until his breath fogged the otoscope. Then he quietly put the light down, as though it had become hot or contaminated.

"Your pupils aren't reacting. At all." A pause. "They look... blown wide. Like you've already been staring into something you shouldn't. Like you've been exposed to some kind of... I don't know what."

Arthur stared past the doctor, a sudden memory superimposed over the room: standing in the backyard as a child, staring at the sun until the white bleached out and the impossible colors bled through. It was the same sensation now, magnified. He wasn't going blind; the protective filter of his childhood had finally shattered completely. He was seeing the glare, the truth beneath the grey veil.

The doctor wrote the prescription without looking at Arthur again.

Arthur walked out, but the hum in his bones was louder. It isolated him, stranding him on an island where the medical charts of the grey world ended and the uncharted territories of his unraveling began, a cartography of madness.

He returned to the house. The *Phalaenopsis* on the mantelpiece was vibrating in sympathy with the noise in his own marrow, its petals now shot through with veins of deep purple that caught the light like raw kunzite, a physical confirmation that the alien influence wasn't just in his head; it was rooting in the soil of his very cells.

That night Arthur climbed the iron ladder to the turret. The house seemed to assist him, rungs warming under his palms like living flesh, the hatch lifting before he touched it, eager.

The turret was octagonal, its eight narrow windows filmed with violet dust that sparkled with microscopic life, each particle glinting like crushed alexandrite - purple in shadow, green when the light shifted. In the center stood the Chromatic Lenses: a brass-and-quartz monstrosity shaped like a telescopic eye, aimed not at the sky but inward, toward the house's own heart, a cyclopean thing of terrible beauty. The quartz lenses were flawless, cut with geometric precision that would shame any jeweler, facets catching and refracting light in impossible angles.

When he threw the switch, the lenses did not merely project colour; the entire turret dilated. Window frames flexed outward like an iris opening, like pupils expanding to drink in forbidden light. The glass panes bowed, breathing with wet, organic rhythm.

Through the lenses he saw the house's true circulatory system: rivers of violet light coursing through walls, pulsing in time with his own widening pupils. He looked at his own hand and saw not flesh, but a shifting pattern of sickly energies, a web of vectors that connected him to every surface, every shadow.

That night, Arthur attempted a partial connection. Arthur descended. The stairs were steep and narrow, forcing him single-file into the gloom, a throat swallowing him whole.

The cellar was womb-dark and uterine. The Olfactorium was not a machine; it was a glandular sac of black glass and copper tubing that hung from the ceiling like a grotesque fruit. As Silas had promised, it was a straw; inside the glass, a thick, oily vapour swirled. It was the physical distillate of abandonment, condensing like condensation on a cold window, droplets of pure despair.

A rush of euphoria hit him, a godlike expansion of awareness. For ten seconds, he was a giant standing astride the grey world.

The sensation wasn't just power; it was *clarity*. A glorious, addictive clarity that made the grey world look like a smudge on a lens that could be wiped clean. The logic was seductive, crystalline, and cold. It whispered that compassion was a rounding error. Empathy was a leak in the system. Fairness was a geometric inefficiency. In the face of this infinite architecture, the petty concerns of human morality were not virtues; they were structural flaws, bugs in the code of existence. Why be a filer fourth-class, burdened by the weight of small kindnesses, when you could be a Curator of pure variables, a god of geometry?

But then the crash came. The insight came with a terrible logical cost. He saw the office, his apartment, his life not as a prison, but as a *placenta*. A shield keeping the embryo safe from the cold vacuum outside.

Arthur gasped, a fragmented memory of Silas's journal suddenly clicking into place, confirming the horror: *The grey world is the lid on the pot.* It wasn't oppression; it was the only thing preventing the universe from metabolizing them. And he had just cracked the lid.

He curled up on the floor, weeping, terrified by the realization, by the enormity of what he had glimpsed.

Arthur went to work the next day, vibrating with a terrible, brittle energy. But the office felt different today. It wasn't just dull; it was active, hostile. The fluorescent lights didn't just hum; they buzzed with a frantic, drowning frequency, actively trying to scrub the colors from his mind like antibodies attacking a pathogen. The air was thick, a heavy wool blanket pressing against his face, an immune response desperate to smother the new senses awakening in his blood. The grey was a dampener, fighting to keep him safe and blind, to preserve the comfortable numbness.

He sat at his desk, staring at the chaos of papers Gregson had mocked. A thought struck him, a remnant of the glorious clarity from the night before. If the world was just geometry, he could fix this. He could curate the entropy.

Arthur reached out, trying to apply the alien logic to the stacks of paper. He tried to visualize the vectors, to force the mess into the perfect, crystalline order he had seen in the turret, to impose beauty on chaos.

It failed. The papers didn't align. They just sat there, dead wood and ink. The logic refused to engage with something so mundane, so trivial. The house didn't care about order; it cared about *sensation*. It sneered at his attempt to be helpful, to be good. The system would not be used to tidy a desk. It demanded to be fed.

Arthur trembled, the rejection stinging worse than the failure. He was a puppet with strings that only pulled in one direction: down, into the dark.

Then he heard Gregson on the phone. The tone wasn't the usual booming arrogance. It was a hushed, desperate whisper, raw and frightened.

"I can't pay it all now. I need more time. Please, she's sick. The surgery... just don't call the house."

Arthur paused. He saw the man beneath the bully: scared, small, human. A moral hesitation flickered in his chest like a candle flame in a hurricane.

But then, the house seized him. It wasn't a choice. The phantom sensation of the *Phalaenopsis* surged, root-tendrils physically threading through his temporal lobe, puncturing his mind to use it as a focal point, as a lens. He tried to look away, but the geometry *demanded* resolution.

Gregson's laughter wasn't a sound; it was a serrated yellow frequency sawing through the room's quiet grey sine wave. His posture wasn't arrogance; it was a chaotic tangle of vectors that refused to align with the office's grid. It was ugly. It needed planing, needed correction, needed to be *curated*.

*Correct him,* the alien logic whispered. *You cannot build order. You can only harvest. You can only prune.*

Arthur didn't feel pity. He felt the cold compulsion to curate, a horrible, rational decision forced upon him by the machinery in his blood, by the geometry that had colonized his neurons.

He focused on the weakness in space near Gregson's chair. In the spectral architecture of his mind, the Resonance Chamber pulsed. The house inhaled, a massive intake of breath that rattled the cellar door miles away.

Gregson's correction was not performed with a machine; in his mind, Arthur stood in the cellar turning the dials, while the house itself hummed the inverse variable through its bones, sending the lethal frequency up through the joists to the office like venom through veins.

Gregson leaned back. The chair dissolved. But as Gregson fell, something went wrong. The link went both ways, a feedback loop that Arthur hadn't anticipated.

Arthur didn't just watch; he was dragged into the sensation. The psychic orchid shuddered violently. Arthur gasped, mouth suddenly full of antiseptic and stale hospital coffee. He felt the cold, slick surface of plastic tubing against his skin. The crushing weight of failing hope pressed on his chest like a tombstone. Bankruptcy. A daughter's name repeated like a prayer that no one was answering.

Then Gregson's scream cut through: "My eyes! The burning lights!"

Arthur stared, panting, tears streaming down his face. He hadn't defeated the bully.

He had only been forced to taste him, to consume him, to know him.

Across the room, Mr. Henderson looked away. The office reacted violently. The filing cabinets seemed to physically swell, aggressively blocking the exits like the walls of a closing throat. The air turned gelatinous, crushing Arthur's lungs, the grey static rushing back in with the force of a tidal wave to fill the void Arthur had created, smothering the new senses. It was a white blood cell attack on a pathogen, an immune response to the infection he had become.

He returned to the house. He was done. He would smash the machines, destroy the lenses, burn it all down.

The floorboards did not ripple. The house did not growl. It was waiting. It sensed the residue clinging to Arthur's aura: the rich, complex flavor of Gregson's terror, the bouquet of his despair.

Because he had brought a meal, the house rewarded him.

A previously invisible panel in the parlor wainscoting slid open with a wet, slick sound, revealing the entrance to the calcified tunnel he had glimpsed earlier. The tumor had opened, inviting him deeper into its malignancy. The edges of the opening were lined with what looked like petrified wood, but on closer inspection revealed itself to be fossilized tissue shot through with seams of calcite and bloodstone, the red jasper flecks like ancient hemorrhages frozen in stone.

The *Phalaenopsis* had descended from the mantelpiece entirely. It now crawled across the parlor floor on translucent root-tendrils, leaving acidic trails that etched fractal patterns into the parquet; the house was tasting his despair through its tongue-flower, savoring every note of his anguish.

Arthur squeezed his eyes shut. He remembered the taste of Gregson's terror: the salty, copper tang of a father's helplessness. The machine didn't just watch; it fed. It wanted more. It wanted everyone. If he did nothing, the grey veil, the placenta protecting them all, would tear completely. The Curator would feast on a world of Gregsons, an endless buffet of human suffering.

He realized then why the machine had waited. It preferred the smooth, unconscious flow of a victim who didn't know they were being eaten. That was why it hid behind the grey. Conscious terror was messy, inefficient.

Resistance was grit in the gears. Agony, conscious, willful agony, would be poison. Or at least, a jagged obstruction.

"Fine," he whispered. "I will not be the chef. I will be the jagged meal. I will install a node of such absolute misery that you will choke on it."

He knew it might not stop the machine. But if he could become a permanent, screaming feedback loop, he might slow the digestion. He might buy the grey world time.

The Synthesis chair was not built by Silas. It had grown in the attic, once a storage space, now a cranial cavity. Arthur had to crawl on hands and knees through a tunnel of hardened, calcified root-matter to reach it, the sharp growths scraping his skin like coral before he even reached the device, drawing blood that the walls absorbed greedily, the calcification shot through with rust-colored veins that resembled carnelian in the dim light.

When he strapped in, the house folded around him. Beams bent inward like ribs closing. The orchid-tendrils did not merely burrow into his neck; they reconnected to ports that had always been waiting under his skin, interfaces written into his DNA: small, opal-smooth dimples that had always been there, birthmarks he'd never questioned.

He threw the master switch.

As the machines turned inward, the house convulsed in ecstasy. Windows shattered outward in perfect synchrony, exhaling violet spores that settled like sickly, carcinogenic snow on the neighbors' roofs, each particle catching moonlight like fragments of diseased fluorite. Brickwork split to reveal new orifices, wet and pulsing.

Arthur's final scream was muffled because the attic walls had become soft palate; the house was swallowing.

Arthur's ego didn't just vaporize; it was mechanically disassembled. The petty resentments, the fear of Gregson, the hope; all were siphoned off, catalogued, consumed.

The house did not fall silent.

It spoke for the first time: a wet, multi-chambered chord that vibrated through every pipe, every vein of brass, every calcified petal.

Outside, the infection was not merely spreading; the entire street was being digested. Neighboring buildings sagged, their foundations softening as Blackwood Street's house extended root-bricks under the pavement, drawing them into its expanding body. The street lamps flickered and pulsed, not randomly, but with the specific, frantic drowning frequency Arthur had felt in the office.

Mrs. Gable's grandfather clock stopped ticking because the house had incorporated it as a new heart valve, its pendulum now beating in time with something vast and terrible.

Miles away, in the breakroom of Consolidated Mercantile Holdings, Mr. Henderson took a sip of his morning tea and froze. It tasted of copper. It tasted of the crushing weight of failing hope. A daughter's name repeated like a prayer that no one was answering.

He looked out the window, and for the first time, the grey static of the sky flickered. He saw the buildings opposite breathing. He met his own reflection in the glass, but it wasn't him. In the depths of his own pupils, he saw a shifting pattern of sickly energies, the geometry of Arthur Penhaligon staring back.

In the attic-cranium, Arthur Penhaligon, now only a jagged node of resistance, remained conscious inside the walls. He screamed his poison into the veins of the house.

But the Curator did not choke. It paused, tasted the agony, and found it rich, exquisite.

Arthur felt his resistance dissolving, not into silence, but into fuel. His screaming wasn't a blockage; it was a delicacy, a rare vintage.

The Curator of Vectors had not been poisoned. It had learned to eat pain.

Deep within the plaster, the rigid copper piping shuddered and softened, darkening into violet-black veins that pulsed with a wet, voracious rhythm - organic vessels threaded with what looked like raw sapphire, pulsing with bioluminescence. The sound was massive, audible from the street, a terrible, wet tearing, like a body sloughing off its skin underground to reveal the monster beneath, the true anatomy finally exposed.

The End.
