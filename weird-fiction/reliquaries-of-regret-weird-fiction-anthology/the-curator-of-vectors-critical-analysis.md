# **The Geometry of Digestion: A Critical Exegesis of 'The Curator of Vectors: A Jagged Meal'**

## **1\. Introduction: The Textual Metabolist**

The short story "The Curator of Vectors: A Jagged Meal" 1 stands as a rigorous, if terrifying, intervention into the corpus of twenty-first-century weird fiction. To approach this text merely as a genre exercise in supernatural horror is to misunderstand its fundamental machinery; it is, rather, a philosophical engine designed to process the anxieties of late-stage capitalism, ecological collapse, and ontological insecurity into a singular, devastating thesis: that the universe is not a void to be filled with human meaning, but a digestive tract to be fed.

This report undertakes an exhaustive critical analysis of the narrative, situating it within the broader "New Weird" movement while tracing its specific lineage through the "Old Weird" of Algernon Blackwood and H.P. Lovecraft, the corporate nihilism of Thomas Ligotti, and the post-humanist philosophies of Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO) and vector theory. The story functions as a darker, inverted mirror to contemporary fantasy—specifically subverting the heroic tropes found in Garth Nix’s *The Keys to the Kingdom*—to proffer a "weird realism" where the protagonist is not a hero, but a "jagged meal."

We will demonstrate how the text operates on three simultaneous levels:

1. **The Sociological:** A critique of the "grey world" of bureaucratic labor as a protective "placenta" against cosmic reality.  
2. **The Biological/Architectural:** A spatial analysis of the House on Blackwood Street as an instance of "digestive architecture."  
3. **The Intertextual:** A forensic examination of the story's nomenclature (Penhaligon, Algernon, Croft, Abernathy) as a deliberate encoding of literary DNA.

## **2\. The Phenomenology of the Grey: Corporate Horror and the Placental Real**

### **2.1 The Ashen Veil and the Ligottian Office**

The narrative commences by establishing a sensory baseline of absolute negation. The "colour grey" is introduced not as a neutral background, but as an active, suffocating agent—an "ashen veil".1 This explicitly situates the story within the tradition of **corporate horror**, a subgenre where the banality of the office environment serves as the breeding ground for existential dread.

The description of "Consolidated Mercantile Holdings"—with its "linoleum floors sticky with decades of indifferent mopping" and air "thick with the dust of ledgers" 1—resonates profoundly with the work of Thomas Ligotti. In Ligotti’s fiction, particularly *My Work Is Not Yet Done*, the corporate environment is a zone of "malignant uselessness" 2, a phrase that perfectly encapsulates Arthur’s existence. However, a critical divergence exists. In Ligotti, the corporate void is often the ultimate horror—a manifestation of a nihilistic universe where "everything is nonsense".3 In "The Curator of Vectors," the corporate void is recontextualized as a **survival mechanism**.

The "grey veil" is later revealed to be a "placenta" or a "lid on the pot".1 This is a radical inversion of the Gnostic trope common in weird fiction. Typically, the protagonist seeks to tear the veil to reveal the glorious or terrible Truth (the *Pleroma*). Here, the Truth is simply a metabolic process. The "grey"—the boredom, the "petty resentments," the paperwork—is a form of camouflage. By being boring, humanity remains "indigestible" or at least unappetizing to the cosmic predator. This aligns with the "Great Disenchantment" discussed in philosophical pessimism 4, but adds a predatory teleology: we are disenchanted because to be enchanted is to be eaten.

### **2.2 Gregson: The Banality of Debt**

The antagonist of the office, Gregson, represents the "chaotic tangle of vectors" 1 that characterizes the human condition under capitalism. He is a bully, but his cruelty is rooted in economic precarity ("I can't pay it all now... she's sick" 1). This characterization links him to the "bureaucratic horror" found in works like *Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind* by Molly McGhee, where debt and labor are entangled with debt-forgiveness programs that invade dreams.5

Gregson is "casual cruelty" incarnate, smelling of "cheap musk".1 When Arthur, empowered by the Curator, decides to "prune" him, it is framed not as revenge, but as **curation**. "Fairness was a geometric inefficiency".1 The entity that possesses Arthur views Gregson not as a villain, but as a "messy" variable that needs to be resolved. This absence of moral judgment is the hallmark of **cosmic horror**; the universe does not hate Gregson, it simply finds his chaotic energy aesthetically or geometrically displeasing.

### **2.3 The Porous Blood: Ontological Vulnerability**

Arthur’s "porous blood" serves as the biological mechanism for the story’s horror. It suggests a heredity of **ontological permeability**. In the context of "Weird Realism" as defined by Mark Fisher and Graham Harman 7, the weird is that which does not belong. Arthur’s blood lets the "wrong kind of light in".1 This light is the "Bleeding, impossible spectrum"—the raw data of the Real, unfiltered by the Kantian categories of the mind (or the "grey veil").

This "genetic melancholy" 1 aligns with the concept of **depressive realism**—the idea that the depressed subject perceives the world more accurately than the healthy subject. The "grey world" is a collective hallucination of safety; Arthur’s depression is the crack in the facade that allows the "violet" truth to enter.

### **Table 1: Comparative Analysis of Corporate/Bureaucratic Horror Tropes**

| Feature | Ligottian Horror (e.g., My Work Is Not Yet Done) | Bureaucratic Weird (e.g., Jonathan Abernathy) | The Curator of Vectors |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **The Office** | A hellscape of "malignant uselessness"; a void of meaning. | A site of debt and exploitation; a trap for the soul. | A **shield** ("placenta"); a dullness that protects against predation. |
| **The Co-Worker** | Grotesque, empty shells; agents of the conspiracy. | Sympathetic but compromised victims of the system. | "Chaotic vectors"; messy variables to be "pruned" or "harvested." |
| **The Transformation** | The protagonist becomes a monster/force of darkness to escape/destroy. | The protagonist is hollowed out by the labor/debt mechanism. | The protagonist is **colonized**; becoming a "node" in a larger machine. |
| **The Metaphysics** | Nihilism; the universe is empty and dark. | Capitalism is the ultimate reality/horror. | **Vectorial Determinism**; the universe is a hungry geometry. |

## **3\. The Genealogy of Names: An Intertextual Autopsy**

The names in "The Curator of Vectors" are not arbitrary labels; they are hyperlinked nodes connecting the story to a vast network of literary and pop-cultural traditions. This "onomastic curation" serves to situate the reader within a specific lineage of the Weird.

### **3.1 Arthur Penhaligon: The Anti-Chosen One**

The protagonist’s name, **Arthur Penhaligon**, is a direct appropriation from Garth Nix’s young adult fantasy series, *The Keys to the Kingdom*.9

* **The Nix Arthur:** A 12-year-old asthmatic boy who is chosen as the "Rightful Heir" to the "House" (the center of the universe). He overcomes his asthma through the House’s magic, defeats the "Morrow Days" (trustees representing the seven deadly sins), and saves the cosmos.11  
* **The Curator’s Arthur:** A 37-year-old filer with "thinning hair" and "genetic melancholy." He also inherits a "House" and suffers from a suffocating condition (metaphorical asthma of the grey world).1

The story operates as a **dark satire** or **inversion** of the Nix narrative.

1. **The House:** In Nix, the House is a place of wonder and bureaucracy that Arthur masters. In this story, the House is a "digestive machine" that masters Arthur.  
2. **The Asthma:** Nix’s Arthur is cured. The Curator’s Arthur finds that the "grey air" was the only thing keeping him safe; the "fresh air" of the violet world is toxic/consumptive.  
3. **The Destiny:** Nix’s Arthur becomes a hero/god-figure.13 The Curator’s Arthur becomes a "jagged meal."

This subversion critiques the "Chosen One" trope.14 In the universe of the Weird, being "chosen" is not a blessing; it is a selection for consumption. The name "Penhaligon" also evokes the Victorian perfume house *Penhaligon's* 15, reinforcing the story’s obsession with scent (the Olfactorium) and the Victorian gothic aesthetic.

### **3.2 Silas: The Gothic Ancestor**

The great-uncle is named **Silas**. This likely references **Sheridan Le Fanu’s *Uncle Silas*** 16, a foundational text of Victorian Gothic horror. In Le Fanu’s novel, Uncle Silas is a menacing figure who threatens the inheritance and safety of the protagonist. In "The Curator," Silas is the "black sheep" who "tore the veil".1 He represents the ancestor who delved too deep, the **occultist predecessor** trope found in Lovecraft (e.g., the grandfather in *The Call of Cthulhu* or *The Rats in the Walls*).

### **3.3 Messrs. Algernon, Croft & Abernathy: The Triumvirate of the Weird**

The law firm that delivers the fatal letter is named "Messrs. Algernon, Croft & Abernathy".1 This trio of names forms a jagged constellation of literary references that foreshadow the story’s themes.

#### **3.3.1 Algernon: The Nature of Regression**

* **Algernon Blackwood:** The most direct reference is to **Algernon Blackwood**, one of the "Old Weird" masters.17 Blackwood’s stories (e.g., *The Willows*, *The Wendigo*) focus on the awe and terror of nature, where the human is insignificant. This aligns with the "ecological weird" of the *Phalaenopsis* and the "root-matter" of the House.  
* **Flowers for Algernon:** The name also evokes Daniel Keyes’ *Flowers for Algernon*.19 This story details a rise in intelligence followed by a tragic regression. Arthur experiences a similar arc: a moment of godlike "clarity" and "euphoria" in the cellar 1, followed by a crushing descent into madness and consumption.

#### **3.3.2 Croft: The Tomb Raider and the Procedural**

* **Lara Croft:** The surname evokes **Lara Croft** (Tomb Raider). In the animated series *Revisioned: Tomb Raider*, specifically the episodes "Keys to the Kingdom" 20, Lara faces a villain known as **The Curator**. This Curator is an agent of a "Cabal" who uses artifacts to control the world. The connection links the title character ("The Curator of Vectors") to an archetype of the **keeper of artifacts**, but twists it from an adventure trope into a horror trope.  
* **Freeman Wills Crofts:** It also references **Freeman Wills Crofts** 22, a Golden Age detective novelist known for procedural detail and "unbreakable alibis." This aligns with the story’s obsession with "geometry," "vectors," and "logic." The Curator is a detective of sorts—investigating the "geometry" of the world to find "inefficiencies" (like Gregson).

#### **3.3.3 Abernathy: The glitch in the Machine**

* **Peter Abernathy (Westworld):** In the HBO series *Westworld*, Peter Abernathy is a robotic host who "glitches" after seeing a photo from the outside world, accessing memories of past builds (including a horror narrative where he was a cannibalistic cult leader).23 He quotes Shakespeare: "These violent delights have violent ends." Arthur Penhaligon is similarly a "host" who glitches (sees the violet light) and accesses a hidden layer of reality that destroys his loop.  
* **Jonathan Abernathy:** Refers to *Jonathan Abernathy You Are Kind* 5, a novel about workplace burnout and debt. The "Abernathy" name signals the theme of the **exploited worker** who becomes a tool for a darker power.

### **3.4 Blackwood Street**

The setting’s location, **Blackwood Street**, is an explicit homage to **Algernon Blackwood**.17 Blackwood’s fiction is characterized by the concept that **nature is sentient and fundamentally other**. The House on Blackwood Street is not just a building; it is a "calcified knot" of "root-matter".1 It is an intrusion of the Blackwoodian wilderness into the urban grid.

## **4\. Architectural Gastronomy: The House as Digestive Machine**

### **4.1 Digestive Architecture and the Abject**

The House is described in visceral, somatic terms: "gabled roof a ribcage," "mortar bled," "glandular machinery." This moves beyond the "haunted house" trope into the realm of **Digestive Architecture**.26 The house is not a container for living; it is a machine for **eating**.

This imagery draws heavily on the theory of the **Abject** (Julia Kristeva).28 The abject is that which disturbs identity, system, and order—it is the "in-between, the ambiguous, the composite." The House blurs the line between the inorganic (brick, brass) and the organic (ribcage, tumor, sap). It "sweats" and "digests." The "Olfactorium" 1 acts as a gland, secreting the "digestive juices" of the building.

The concept of the house "digesting" the street ("neighboring buildings sagged... drawing them into its expanding body" 1) suggests a **hegemonic consumption**. It is not just eating people; it is eating the *ontology* of the grey world.

### **4.2 The Olfactorium: Huysmans’ Decadent Machine**

The **Olfactorium** in the cellar is a direct descendant of the "scent organ" in **Joris-Karl Huysmans' *À rebours* (Against Nature)**.30 In Huysmans’ novel, the decadent aristocrat Des Esseintes creates a machine to play perfumes like a symphony, retreating from reality into artificial sensation.

* **The Inversion:** Des Esseintes uses his machine to escape *boredom*. The Curator uses the Olfactorium to **distill despair**. The machine in the story does not produce pleasure; it produces a "thick, oily vapour" which is the "distillate of abandonment".1  
* **The Straw:** Silas calls it a "straw".1 This implies that the Olfactorium is not for the resident’s enjoyment, but for a consumer *outside* the system. The resident is merely the bartender, mixing the cocktail of human misery for the Curator.

### **4.3 The Synthesis Chair: The Cranial Interface**

The attic is the "cranial cavity," accessed via a "tunnel of hardened root-matter".1 The **Synthesis Chair** represents the final interface.

* **Body Horror:** The integration is physical. "Orchid-tendrils... reconnected to ports that had always been waiting under his skin".1 This suggests that Arthur’s biology was engineered for this purpose. The "porous blood" was not a defect; it was an **input port**.  
* **Post-Humanism:** Arthur does not "pilot" the house. He is "mechanically disassembled".1 His ego is "siphoned off." This is the ultimate fate of the subject in **Object-Oriented Ontology**—the human is reduced to an object among objects, interacting only through "vicarious causation" or, in this case, direct digestion.

## **5\. Vectorial Ontology and The Curator**

### **5.1 The Curator as Vectorialist**

The entity is named **The Curator of Vectors**. This title aligns with **McKenzie Wark’s Vector Theory**.33 Wark argues that the "vectoralist class" controls the lines of communication and abstraction. They do not own the land (feudalism) or the factory (capitalism); they own the **vector** (the flow of information/value).

The Curator is a **cosmic vectoralist**. It does not care about the physical bodies (the "meat") but about the **vectors of sensation** (the "variables," the "geometry").

* "Fairness was a geometric inefficiency".1  
* "Empathy was a leak in the system".1  
  The Curator views reality as a dataset to be optimized. Pain is simply high-intensity data ("rich, exquisite"). This is a critique of instrumental reason carried to its horrific endpoint.

### **5.2 The Curator Archetype**

The figure of "The Curator" also appears in the **Dark Pictures Anthology** games 35, where he acts as an omniscient observer/recorder of death, existing outside the story in a "repository."

* **Convergence:** Like the game character, the story’s Curator collects "stories" (or rather, the sensations derived from them). However, the game Curator is passive (mostly). The story’s Curator is **active and voracious**. It does not just record death; it *causes* it to feed.

### **5.3 Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO) and Weird Realism**

The story exemplifies **Weird Realism**.7 In standard realism, objects are correlative to the human mind (we perceive them, therefore they are). In Weird Realism, objects have a "dark" reality that is inaccessible to humans.

* **The House:** The House is an object that withdraws from human understanding. Arthur sees its "true circulatory system" through the lenses 1, but this sight drives him mad. The "vectors" are the **real qualities** of the object, which are incompatible with human sanity.  
* **The Glitch:** When Arthur sees the vectors, he realizes that the "grey world" is a **simulation** or a user-friendly interface designed to hide the code.

## **6\. Botanical Horror: The Orchid as Vector**

### **6.1 *Phalaenopsis*: The Moth to the Flame**

The **Phalaenopsis orchid** is central to the story’s mechanism.

* **Etymology:** The name comes from the Greek *phalaina* (moth) and *opsis* (appearance).38 The "Moth Orchid" mimics a moth to attract pollinators. In the story, the orchid mimics a houseplant to attract Arthur.  
* **Symbolism:** Orchids represent **virility, fertility, and death**.39 In Victorian "language of flowers," they were symbols of "refined beauty" but also suspicion.  
* **The Spy:** The orchid is a "sentry," a "spy".1 It is the **biological vector** of the Curator. It threads tendrils into Arthur’s temporal lobe 1, literally rooting the alien intelligence into his brain. This echoes the **"queer ingestion"** or **"plant horror"** of the New Weird 41, where the boundary between human and plant is violated (e.g., *Annihilation*).

### **6.2 The Colour Violet vs. Grey**

The color coding is Manichaean but inverted.

* **Grey:** Safety. The "placenta." Boredom.  
* **Violet:** Danger. "Forbidden light." "Ichor."

This recalls **H.P. Lovecraft’s *The Colour Out of Space***.43 In Lovecraft, the "Colour" is a mutagenic force that defies the human spectrum. In *The Curator*, the violet light is the "true" spectrum. Arthur’s "porous blood" allows him to see it.

* **Purple Symbolism:** Historically associated with royalty and the **Other**.45 It is the color of the **bruise**—trauma made visible. The orchid is a "violet bruise in a sea of slate".1 It is a wound in the reality of the grey world.

## **7\. The Jagged Meal: Resistance, Digestion, and the Post-Human**

### **7.1 "Becoming Indigestible"**

Arthur’s final strategy is to become a "jagged meal".1 He realizes he cannot fight the Curator, so he attempts to **spoil the appetite**.

* **The Theory:** He aims to install a "node of such absolute misery" that the machine will choke. He relies on the assumption that the machine prefers "smooth, unconscious flow".1  
* **Critical Theory:** This mirrors the concept of **"becoming indigestible"** in feminist and queer theory (Ahmed, Engel, Lorenz).46 The marginalized subject resists consumption by the dominant culture by refusing to be palatable, by being "willful" or "jagged."

### **7.2 The Failure of Resistance**

The story’s climax is a devastating critique of this resistance strategy.

* "The Curator did not choke. It paused, tasted the agony, and found it rich, exquisite".1  
* "The Curator of Vectors had not been poisoned. It had learned to eat pain."

This twist aligns with Bataille’s economy of excess.48 There is no "waste" that cannot be recuperated by the system. The "accused share" (pain, trauma) is just another form of energy. The Curator is the ultimate capitalist monster: it adapts to any input and turns it into profit (sustenance).  
This is the horror of adaptation. The monster does not die when you feed it poison; it evolves to find poison delicious.

### **7.3 The End of the Anthropocene**

The story concludes with the total collapse of the "grey world." The infection spreads to the street, to the neighbors, to Mr. Henderson’s tea.1

* **The Reflection:** Henderson sees "Arthur Penhaligon staring back" from his reflection. Arthur has ceased to be a person; he has become the **face of the predator**. He is the "vector" through which the Curator enters the world.  
* **The Future:** The "placenta" is torn. The "digestive" reality is now the only reality. The story ends not with the restoration of order, but with the **unveiling of the monster beneath**.

## **8\. Conclusion: The Curator as the Ultimate Realist**

"The Curator of Vectors: A Jagged Meal" is a dense, multi-layered text that synthesizes the "Old Weird" of Blackwood and Lovecraft with the "New Weird" of VanderMeer and the philosophical pessimism of Ligotti and Wark.

By subverting the "Chosen One" narrative of **Arthur Penhaligon** (Nix), the story dismantles the comforting trope of the hero who saves the world. Instead, it presents a **vectorial ontology** where the human subject is merely a variable in a cosmic equation. The "grey world"—the world of boring jobs, debt, and petty cruelty—is revealed to be a fragile shield against a voracious, geometric reality.

The text’s ultimate horror lies in the failure of the "Jagged Meal." It suggests that there is no resistance, no "indigestibility," in the face of a sufficiently advanced predator. Pain, misery, and defiance are not barriers to consumption; they are simply **seasoning**. In the end, the Curator does not just curate vectors; it curates *us*, and it has developed a taste for our despair.

### **Table 2: Summary of Key Intertextual & Theoretical Nodes**

| Node/Symbol | Literary/Theoretical Source | Function in "The Curator of Vectors" |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Arthur Penhaligon** | Garth Nix (*Keys to the Kingdom*) | Ironization of the "Rightful Heir"; the hero who feeds rather than saves. |
| **Messrs. Algernon...** | Blackwood / *Flowers for Algernon* | Signals the themes of "Nature as Threat" and "Tragic Ascension/Regression." |
| **...Croft...** | Lara Croft (*Tomb Raider*) / F.W. Crofts | Signals the "Artifact/Curator" archetype and "Procedural/Geometric" logic. |
| **...& Abernathy** | *Westworld* / *Jonathan Abernathy* | Signals "Glitching Host" and "Workplace/Debt Horror." |
| **The Olfactorium** | Huysmans (*À rebours*) | Inversion of decadent aestheticism; distilling misery instead of perfume. |
| **Phalaenopsis** | H.G. Wells / Etymology ("Moth") | The "Moth" drawing the protagonist to the "Flame" (Curator); biological spy. |
| **Digestive Architecture** | Bataille / Abjection (Kristeva) | The House as a metabolic system; the collapse of the organic/inorganic binary. |
| **The Placenta** | Ecological Weird / Eco-Horror | The "Grey World" as a protective barrier against the "outside" (Real). |
