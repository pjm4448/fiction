# Echoes in the Schist

## Summary

In 1937, geologist Arthur Galloway probes eerie disturbances at Station Peak Station in New Zealand's haunting Southern Alps. The Campbell family, isolated in the Canterbury High Country, unravels under a sinister hum from Mount Arrowsmith. Sheep flee, compasses fail, and alien crystals defy science. Echoes of the forbidden Miskatonic Expedition fuel Galloway's dread of a colossal, slumbering entity. As madness grips the Campbells, a psychic assault forces his escape. His chilling findings, buried by a secretive government, leave him haunted by guilt and a cosmic truth too terrifying to unleash.

## Chapter 1: The Unsettling Summons to Station Peak

The dossier struck Arthur Galloway's chaotically burdened desk within the Geological Survey's warren-like chambers (those grim governmental edifices overlooking the slate-grey expanse of Wellington Harbour) with a sodden finality that scarcely surmounted the incessant mechanical clatter of typewriters and the distant, mournful ululation of some departing vessel upon the quay. It was mid-afternoon upon a day of blustering, ill-favoured winds in the waning weeks of Spring, Anno Domini 1937. Without, tempestuous gusts assailed the nascent structure of the building's edifice and tore with spiteful violence at laundry lines strung like strange sigils across the cramped backyards of Thorndon far below. Within, Galloway (a geologist whose fortieth year was but lately passed, his youthful ardour for the raw earth now settled into a staid, almost sepulchral routine of mineralogical appraisals and the tedious collation of seismic disturbances) peered through his spectacles at the buff manila folder. Standard governmental issue yet tainted somehow... imbued with a subtle miasma of reluctance. The internal routing chit attested to its passage through several unwilling hands, none seemingly eager to claim its dubious contents.

He slit it open. No dense strata charts awaited his perusal, no bureaucratic demands for analysis of core samples wrested from Taranaki's hopeful but likely futile petroleum explorations. Instead, clipped with grim precision, were facsimile copies of agitated, handwritten epistles, penned in a script neat yet betraying an accelerating tremor, by one Mrs. Margaret Campbell of 'Station Peak Station,' a place lost within the desolate vastness of the Canterbury High Country. The letters, dispatched over dreary months to a sibling residing in Timaru, spoke initially of commonplace rural anxieties: drought, the ruinous price of wool, the familiar spectres haunting a Depression-blighted agrarian existence. Gradually, however, they transmuted into narratives altogether more tenebrous and unsettling. There came complaints of persistent cephalalgia; of sheep exhibiting unnatural, panic-stricken flocking behaviour or scattering in mindless terror without visible cause; of sheepdogs whining incessantly through the black hours of night, refusing with stark dread to venture near the upper pastures shrouded in perpetual gloom.

Then emerged descriptions of the 'humming' or 'vibration': a profound, subterranean thrumming felt through the very soles of one's boots, seeming at times to emanate from the oppressive air itself, its intensity most pronounced near the cyclopean mountain mass dominating their western vista. Appended to these disturbing missives was a brief, perplexed report from a rural mail carrier, one Jock Davidson, a man known for his prosaic reliability, who served as a de facto observer of untoward incidents upon his lonely, circuitous high-country route. Davidson noted the palpable psychic distress afflicting the Campbell family, their increasingly morbid reclusiveness, and corroborated their fearful accounts of a 'damned queer thrumming noise' and the baffling derangement of magnetic compasses near the isolated station homestead. He had methodically checked his vehicle's engine; the humming telephone wires yielded naught by way of rational explanation. Finally, there lay a cursory initial assessment from some regional outpost near Geraldine, muttering of 'inconclusive resonant phenomena,' tentatively ascribed to 'aeolian effects in peculiar rock formations' or 'unusual seismic echoes' monstrously amplified by the valley's morphology. The report essentially dismissed the horror as mere wind or insignificant earth tremors.

Galloway leaned back, his chair groaning under the psychic weight as much as the physical, tapping a pencil against the ominous file. Aeolian resonance? Possibly conceivable, yet the patterned, almost rhythmic quality Margaret Campbell described... the correlation with magnetic perturbations Jock Davidson noted... that bespoke something outside the wholesome normalcy of known geology. He drew forth a large-scale topographical map, its contours depicting the vast emptiness of the region. Station Peak Station. He located its pinpoint representation, nestled deep within a protracted glacial excavation, high, bordering the formidable spine of the main divide, dwarfed by peaks bearing names evocative of primordial ruggedness and soul-crushing isolation. And there, looming vast and menacing to the west, stood the designated mass of Mount Arrowsmith, soaring beyond 9,000 feet, a formidable titan even amongst the jagged ramparts of the Southern Alps. Remote. Geologically labyrinthine, predominantly schist and greywacke, scarred by ancient glaciers. No known volcanism or significant geothermal taint for hundreds of desolate miles.

A flicker of something deeper, more perilous than routine professional curiosity, stirred within his breast. Galloway, despite the rigid pragmatism of his scientific indoctrination, harboured a secret, almost shameful fascination for the anomalous, for those terrifying inconsistencies that refused assimilation into accepted theoretical frameworks. This morbid predilection had been dangerously inflamed years prior when, through shadowed academic channels, he had obtained a partial, illicitly transcribed copy of the suppressed, infamous report authored by Professor Dyer concerning the ill-fated Miskatonic University Antarctic Expedition of 1930-31. Publicly, he parroted dismissals of the wilder, more sanity-shattering claims (living Elder Things, protoplasmic Shoggoths) as mere stress-induced delusion born of polar extremity. Yet, Dyer's meticulously detailed descriptions of bizarre, non-Euclidean geometries discovered within ancient, unhallowed Antarctic mountains, the unsettling atmospheric piping sounds suggestive of monstrous flutes, and the anomalous, alien geology: these had insidiously lodged themselves within the unlit recesses of his subconscious. He found himself rereading those forbidden passages late at night, when the world slept unaware, wondering... dreading...

This Campbell affair... low-frequency resonance, seemingly patterned, synchronous magnetic disturbances, deleterious psychological effects upon man and beast, a remote mountain fastness... The parallels, however faint and tenuous, were profoundly unnerving. He glanced again at the file, at the polite departmental memorandum suggesting a 'brief field visit to confirm ambient geological conditions and expeditiously close the inquiry.' He could delegate this task to some junior, blissfully ignorant geologist. Or...

He initialled the assignment sheet himself, the pen scratching with a sound like dry bones. Officially, it constituted a straightforward, mundane task. Unofficially, it felt akin to stepping deliberately from the well-trodden path of reason into shadowed borderlands where sanity feared to tread. As he commenced the requisitioning of equipment later that week (the ponderous portable seismograph units with their clockwork recording drums, magnetometers whose needles might soon dance to unholy rhythms, geological hammers for striking against rock that perhaps should not be struck, sample bags for potentially blasphemous fragments, sturdy hobnail boots for traversing accursed ground, oilskins against primordial rains, and sufficient rations for a fortnight's isolation from the comforting world of men) he paused. Then, retrieving the worn, typed Dyer transcript from its clandestine sanctuary within a dull treatise on sedimentary strata, he carefully secreted it deep within his personal kitbag. Merely for background context, he assured himself once more. Context for phenomena encountered in extreme, hostile environments. Nothing more sinister.

The southward journey commenced two weeks hence, a gradual, unnerving immersion into a New Zealand utterly alien to the bureaucratic clamour of Wellington. He embarked upon the nocturnal steamer, the TSS Rangatira, from Wellington's dockside, the air thick with the acrid stench of coal smoke, corrosive brine, and the damp, unsettling odour of wool bales gathered from countless remote pastures. Standing upon the vessel's deck as it pulled away from the receding, deceptively cheerful lights of the city, the steady, mechanical throb of the turbines beneath his feet felt solid, reassuringly mundane: a world removed from the unsettling, earth-born resonance towards which he inexorably travelled. He shared the saloon deck with taciturn commercial travellers nursing potent whiskies, a few families bound for southern destinations, and rough-handed men returning to desolate farms or bleak public works projects, their muttered conversations a desultory litany of stock prices, rugby scores, and the lingering spectral hardships of the Depression years.

Disembarking at Lyttleton the following morn amidst the cacophony of scavenging gulls and the clangour of cargo cranes, he boarded the train that crawled with painstaking slowness across the vast, unnervingly flat expanse of the Canterbury Plains. Patchwork fields yielded to wide, braided riverbeds choked with greywacke stones, detritus washed down from the distant, brooding mountains. The sky here seemed monstrously immense, the light possessing a cruel, actinic sharpness. In the distance, growing ever larger, more menacing, the Southern Alps reared like the serrated spine of some colossal, petrified beast, their peaks gleaming with ancient snows. The distinctive, pallid slash of the Nor'west arch (ominous herald of the powerful, desiccating foehn wind that often scourged the eastern ranges) was painted high above them like a celestial omen.

From the terminus, where the air already held the crisp, thin edge of the high country and incipient dread, he procured a sturdy Ford truck and a driver whose taciturnity bordered on the morose. They jolted for hours along gravel tracks that climbed relentlessly inland, a plume of choking dust trailing behind them like a funerary shroud. The landscape grew progressively barer, grander, more terrifyingly lonely. Tussock land stretched towards desolate horizons, fractured by stark rock outcrops and the occasional windswept cluster of structures marking some sprawling, isolated sheep station. They passed slow-moving mobs of sheep being driven by weathered, spectral figures on horseback, their dogs weaving with uncanny expertise through the bleating flock.

At last, even the truck could penetrate no further into the wilderness. Mr. Donald Campbell materialized there, a man whose sun-ravaged countenance showed the profound psychic strain beneath a reserved, high-country formality of welcome. Galloway's instruments and supplies were transferred to the backs of packhorses for the final, arduous stage of the journey into the encroaching unknown. They rode for timeless hours, deeper into the crushing, primordial silence of the mountains, following a track barely discernible from the surrounding desolation, ascending a long glacial valley carved by forces beyond human comprehension. The air grew thinner, colder, charged with an unseen tension. The scale was breathtaking, utterly humbling: vast screes and tussock slopes rising towards jagged, knife-edge ridgelines beneath a sky of piercing, indifferent clarity. The world contracted to the rhythmic plodding of the horses, the desolate cry of a distant, unseen kea, the rushing murmur of glacial streams singing songs of immense cold and entropy.

Station Peak Station manifested itself suddenly around a fold in the land: a meagre cluster of simple, utilitarian structures fashioned from timber and corrugated iron, weathered to a spectral silver-grey, huddled beside a protective, yet somehow menacing, stand of ancient mountain beech trees. Smoke curled like a grasping tendril from a solitary chimney. A few sheep scattered nervously from their path. It seemed utterly isolated, a tiny, fragile outpost of human endeavour pitted against the immense, soul-chilling indifference of the mountains. Looming behind it, dominating the western aspect, crushing the sky, rose the dark, cyclopean mass of Mount Arrowsmith, its upper reaches already stained by the cold, pinkish fire of the alpenglow.

Margaret Campbell emerged onto the homestead's porch as they drew near, wiping her hands abstractedly on her apron. Her smile of welcome was a strained rictus, failing utterly to conceal the febrile anxiety flickering in her eyes as they darted towards the brooding mountain, then back to the intruding stranger. Their son, Ian, a lanky, preternaturally silent youth of approximately sixteen summers, materialized wraith-like from the Stygian gloom of the shearing shed, observing the newcomer with a guarded, almost hostile curiosity.

Galloway shook Donald Campbell's calloused, strangely cold hand once more, then Margaret's, offering a smile intended to convey professional reassurance but which felt like a grotesque parody upon his own face. "Thank you for accommodating me, Mrs. Campbell, Mr. Campbell. I shall endeavour to cause minimal disruption."

"No trouble whatsoever, Mr. Galloway," Margaret replied, her voice soft yet stretched taut as a fraying nerve. "We are merely... relieved that someone has finally condescended to investigate... these matters."

That first evening, following a simple, hearty repast of roast mutton and potatoes consumed largely in a heavy, oppressive silence around the scrubbed kitchen table, Galloway commenced his initial deployment. He selected a patch of level ground near the homestead, somewhat shielded from the mournful sighing of the wind, and carefully unpacked his primary seismograph unit, anchoring it with grim determination. As he knelt, adjusting the delicate stylus upon the smoked paper drum, verifying the clockwork mechanism's steady beat, he felt it again, stronger now, more insistent, rising seemingly from the very bedrock beneath his knees: not a sound discernible to the coarse mechanism of the human ear, but a deep, almost subsonic vibration, a physical pressure that resonated within his very bones, pulsed faintly behind his eyes like a morbid migraine. It manifested, lingered for what felt like thirty seconds of terrifying intimacy, then faded, leaving behind an unnerving silence that felt somehow deeper, more pregnant with watchful malevolence, than before.

He glanced sharply towards the homestead. A solitary lamp cast a sickly yellow glow in the kitchen window. Beyond it, the vast, Stygian bulk of Mount Arrowsmith stood stark and menacing against the star-dusted, freezing vault of the alpine sky. The air was utterly still, deathly cold. The investigation had commenced, and already, Arthur Galloway felt a profound chill that owed nothing to the mountain air, but everything to the dawning, hideous suspicion of what lay slumbering beneath.

## Chapter 2: The Abyssal Resonance in the Valley

The ensuing days at Station Peak Station congealed into a tense, nerve-shredding routine, governed by the rhythms of Galloway's increasingly disturbing investigation and the capricious, malevolent manifestations of the resonance. He established a network of secondary seismograph stations across the desolate valley floor, meticulously triangulating the signal's point of origin. The resulting data was unambiguous, chillingly consistent, utterly inimical to established geological doctrine: the epicentre was not shallow, correlating with no known fault line or terrestrial stress point. It pulsed from abyssal depths within the very heart of Mount Arrowsmith itself, kilometres below the surface, emanating from a source far too focused, too geometrically precise, for any natural tectonic spasm. The magnetometers corroborated the profound strangeness, mapping intense, fluctuating electromagnetic fields of baffling complexity that waxed and waned in perfect, terrifying synchronicity with the subsonic hum, distorting compass readings into wild, meaningless gyrations near the mountain's brooding base.

Galloway laboured with meticulous, almost frantic care, forcing himself to adhere to the comforting rituals of scientific process even as a primal, nameless dread began to uncoil within the deepest recesses of his soul. He gathered rock samples, discovering further intrusions of the glassy, obsidian-like crystal (utterly non-terrestrial in aspect) particularly in areas marked by recent rockfalls or glacial scouring high upon Arrowsmith's cyclopean flanks. He mapped their distribution with growing unease; they seemed to trace profound fissures, like dark, unwholesome veins penetrating the mountain's ancient stone flesh. He attempted audio recordings, employing sensitive microphones and powerful amplifiers. While the fundamental hum remained stubbornly below the threshold of human audition, the recordings captured a disturbing, intricate tapestry of complex harmonics and unnatural overtones, forming patterns that seemed hideously, chillingly suggestive of intelligence, utterly unlike random terrestrial noise. Certain high-frequency components, wholly undetectable by the unaided ear, appeared to induce intense, inexplicable agitation in the station's sheepdogs whenever the recording apparatus was active near the sites where the alien crystal extruded from the earth.

Back in the makeshift laboratory he had established within a corner of the dusty, wool-scented shearing shed (a place redolent of mundane animal husbandry now tainted by cosmic horror) the microscope revealed the true, soul-chilling horror of the crystalline substance. Its internal structure defied all earthly crystallography, mocking the ordered laws of terrestrial physics. Under high magnification, the faint, sickly internal phosphorescence resolved into slow, rhythmic, pulsating movements within intricate, cell-like chambers bounded by planes that intersected at impossible, non-Euclidean angles. It looked hideously, incontrovertibly alive, or at least organised upon biological principles utterly alien, profoundly hostile, to terrestrial science. When he risked chipping a minuscule fragment (the substance resisted the geological hammer with unnatural tenacity) the sample oozed a thin, translucent ichor that smoked faintly upon contact with the wholesome air and, when placed upon a piece of native greywacke overnight, dissolved the familiar stone into a grey, amorphous sludge by morning.

He desperately sought refuge in mundane explanations: residual magnetism, piezoelectric effects within quartz-rich schist subjected to unimaginable tectonic stress, anomalous atmospheric ducting of low-frequency acoustic phenomena. He scribbled equations, consulted regional seismic charts, pored over his geological maps until his eyes burned. None of it availed. All rational, earthly explanations crumbled into dust before the combined, monstrous weight of the patterned resonance, the focused subterranean energy source, the magnetic chaos, the fundamentally alien structure of the crystals, and the documented, deleterious effects upon living creatures: effects hinting at psychic as well as physical disruption.

The strain upon the Campbells manifested in increasingly alarming, sanity-eroding ways. Donald, the archetype of the stoic, resilient high-country farmer, became prone to prolonged, unnerving silences, his eyes fixed upon Mount Arrowsmith with a disturbing, terrifying vacancy. Sometimes Galloway would observe him standing motionless by a fence line for hours on end, seemingly oblivious to the biting wind, as if attending to some silent, internal summons perceptible only to him. Margaret's initial febrile anxiety had deepened into a brittle, morbid exhaustion, punctuated by moments of near-hysterical collapse. She confessed to Galloway during one tense, lamp-lit evening, her voice a trembling whisper, her hands twisting her apron into knots, that the nightmares were becoming more frequent, more hideously vivid. "It's not merely pictures, Mr. Galloway," she'd stammered, raw terror dilating her pupils. "It's... sensations. Like being enveloped within something immense, and cold, and... thinking, but not as we comprehend thought. And the shapes... oh, merciful God, the blasphemous shapes..." Young Ian, meanwhile, grew progressively more withdrawn and sullen, refusing his chores if they required him to venture far from the dubious sanctuary of the homestead, sometimes discovered huddled in the stable's oppressive gloom, sketching disturbing, complex geometric patterns of maddening intricacy into the dirt floor.

Radio communication with the outside world, their fragile tether to normalcy, became unreliable, dissolving into bursts of hostile static that seemed to pulse in ghastly rhythm with the subterranean hum whenever transmission was attempted near the accursed mountain. Even the mail carrier, Davidson, began fabricating excuses to leave his deliveries at the valley entrance swing bridge, unnerved by the palpable 'bad feeling,' the psychic miasma that now clung to the upper reaches of the station. They were truly isolated now, trapped within this desolate amphitheatre of stone, caught between the indifferent, cyclopean peaks and the nameless Thing that slept, or dreamt, within one of them.

Galloway documented everything in his field notebook, the precise scientific observations increasingly interspersed with frantic, speculative, near-hysterical annotations. He reread the forbidden Dyer transcript nightly, the hideous parallels now screamingly, undeniably obvious. *Cyclopean architecture... non-Euclidean geometry... baffling physiological processes suggesting realms beyond life and death... protoplasmic horrors... vast, soul-crushing timescales... atmospheric piping suggestive of monstrous entities...* It all coalesced into a single, monstrous, sanity-threatening conclusion: the resonance wasn't merely a phenomenon; it was a symptom. A symptom of a dormant, fitfully dreaming, biological or quasi-biological entity of continental, perhaps planetary, scale, embedded deep within the ancient, primordial rock of the Alps. An entity whose mere quiescent presence, whose slow, utterly alien metabolism, generated forces that warped the fabric of reality and shattered vulnerable human minds. Mount Arrowsmith wasn't just a mountain; it was a tomb, a cradle, a monstrously slumbering god of outer horrors.

The breaking point arrived with terrifying, catastrophic suddenness. It was a night of preternatural clarity, intensely, bitingly cold, the sky ablaze with mocking, indifferent stars. The usual intermittent hum had faded into an unnerving, watchful silence earlier that day, a silence more dreadful than the sound itself. Galloway was within the homestead, comparing his latest magnetometer readings with Margaret, attempting a facade of scientific calm, while Donald stared with unnerving fixity out the window towards the black, crushing mass of Arrowsmith. Ian was presumed to be in his small, adjacent bedroom. Suddenly, the silence was annihilated. It wasn't a noise apprehended by the ear, but an immense pressure, a colossal psychic weight that slammed down upon the valley with physical force. The lamp upon the table flickered violently, its flame guttering as if starved of wholesome air. Galloway felt his vision tunnel, constrict; the familiar, comforting dimensions of the room seemed to twist, flow, and writhe in nauseating flux. The very air grew thick, viscous, filled with a silent, multi-layered scream of utterly alien consciousness: vast, cold, ancient, profoundly indifferent, yet overwhelmingly, suffocatingly present. He saw, not with his physical eyes but projected directly onto the canvas of his mind, dizzying, impossible vistas of shifting geometric forms, nightmarish glimpses of colossal, non-Euclidean organs functioning in slow, deliberate motion across gulfs of time that defied comprehension, felt the crushing, soul-destroying ennui of existence measured in millennia.

He fought his way back to a semblance of awareness, gasping for air that seemed thin and tainted, the room swimming horridly back into focus. Margaret was slumped against the wall, her face a mask of chalky white, trembling uncontrollably, her eyes wide with the unutterable terror she had just witnessed in her mind. Ian stood frozen in the doorway of his room, equally stunned into catatonia. But Donald Campbell... he stood rigid, ramrod straight, in the centre of the floor, facing the window, facing the mountain. His posture was unnaturally stiff, his head cocked as if listening intently to some unheard, unholy dictate. When he turned, slowly, deliberately, his eyes were wide, utterly vacant of the man Galloway had known, yet filled with a terrifying, cold, pale blue luminescence that seemed to reflect the starlight outside, amplified, imbued with a chilling, utterly alien intelligence.

"'It calls,'" Donald whispered, and the voice issuing from his throat was hideously wrong: deeper, resonant, seeming to vibrate not merely in the air but within the very marrow of Galloway's bones. "The sleep is... troubled. We must join the resonance. Become one with the mountain. Be... subsumed. Complete." He took a slow, deliberate, inexorable step towards Galloway, his work-hardened hands clenching and unclenching with terrifying deliberation, an expression of awful, serene, inhuman purpose smoothing the familiar, human lines from his face into a terrifying mask.

"Run, Mr. Galloway! Flee!" Margaret shrieked, shoving her frozen son violently towards the door while desperately, heroically attempting to grapple with her husband, who now moved with an unnatural, terrifying strength that belied his mortal frame. "He's... it has taken him! Go now! Save yourself!"

For a fraction of a second, Galloway was paralyzed, the instinct to render aid warring with raw, primal, overwhelming terror. He saw Margaret brace herself against Donald's inhuman strength, placing her frail body squarely between the monstrous danger and their only avenue of escape. He saw the sheer, uncomprehending terror in young Ian's eyes as the boy glanced back, wild-eyed, at his mother. Then, the survival instinct, sharp, undeniable, utterly selfish, surged and conquered all else. Clutching his vital field notebook (its pages filled with data that now felt like a pathetic, useless epitaph) and the small, heavy sample box containing the ichor-weeping crystal shard, proof of unspeakable realities, Galloway bolted through the back door after Ian, slamming it shut behind him. The sound echoed like a gunshot in the sudden, ringing silence left by the receding psychic wave, a silence heavy with doom. He did not look back; he could not bear the thought of what horrors might be visible through the window. But the sounds pursued him like phantom hounds as he sprinted frantically across the frozen, unforgiving ground towards the barely visible track leading down-valley: Margaret's desperate, fading cries mingling horribly with the crash of furniture within the violated homestead, and underlying it all, that awful, profound, resonant cry that seemed to issue not from the possessed form of Donald Campbell, but from the very stone heart of Mount Arrowsmith itself, a sound of vast, sleeping, abyssal power momentarily, dreadfully disturbed.

He was abandoning them. The knowledge struck him like a physical blow, a cold shard of ice twisting alongside the frantic terror propelling his legs as they carried him desperately down the dark, treacherous track, away from the cursed station, away from the family destroyed by forces utterly beyond human ken or reckoning. The terrible, lurking presence beneath the ancient peaks of the Southern Alps (and the sickening, indelible memory of his own precipitous flight) was burning itself into the fabric of his soul. He just ran, stumbling blindly on loose scree, splashing through streams whose waters felt like liquid ice, the indifferent, remote stars wheeling cold and uncaring overhead, the immense silence of the mountains pressing in upon him, a silence that now felt terrifyingly, malevolently watchful.

## Chapter 3: Galloway's Accursed Burden

Arthur Galloway stumbled into the first squalid outpost of mundane humanity (a musterer's primitive hut situated lower in the valley's oppressive maw) several days later, a figure ravaged by exhaustion, frostbite, and a profound spiritual flaying that left deeper scars than any physical hardship. He was barely coherent, his initial frenzied attempts to articulate the horror met with concerned yet utterly uncomprehending stares from men whose realities were bounded by rock, river, and wage packets. He spoke wildly, raving of subterranean vibrations, impossible crystalline structures born of alien dimensions, of Donald Campbell driven to monstrous madness, of a living, sentient mountain brooding under the innocent sky. Eventually, he was conveyed back to the nearest township, where a sympathetic physician treated his manifest physical ailments and quietly recommended protracted rest, perhaps a long convalescence in some distant sanatorium, attributing his pitiable state to severe psychological stress and prolonged exposure. 'High-country madness,' the doctor privately termed it, a convenient label for truths too monstrous to contemplate.

But Galloway knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the core, that it was not madness, not in the conventional, comforting sense. Back within the familiar confines of his Wellington flat, overlooking the bustling harbour whose mundane activities now seemed a fragile, pathetic illusion, worlds removed from the silent, menacing peaks, the true, crushing weight of his experience settled upon him like a funeral shroud. He was haunted not merely by the undeniable, meticulously documented scientific evidence of the vast, slumbering, alien entity entombed within Mount Arrowsmith, but by the sharp, perpetually recurring image of Margaret Campbell's terrified, yet inexplicably courageous face as she grappled with her transfigured husband, desperately buying precious seconds for his own craven escape. The towering, indifferent grandeur of the Southern Alps, captured in sterile photographs upon his wall, now seemed accusatory, silent, cyclopean witnesses to his own moment of frantic, instinctual self-preservation: an act that, replayed endlessly in the black, sleepless voids of the night, felt increasingly like an act of unforgivable, soul-staining cowardice.

He poured weeks, then months, into the composition of his report. It became a consuming obsession, a frantic outpouring of horror disguised beneath a veneer of meticulous scientific rigour. He detailed with painstaking precision the seismograph readings revealing the profound, patterned, non-terrestrial resonance; the magnetometer data mapping the chaotic, pulsing energy fields inimical to known physics; the microscopic analysis and chemical tests performed upon the crystalline samples, their structures defying the very laws of matter and biology as understood by man. He included sketches rendered with a trembling hand, photographs capturing unsettling anomalies of light and shadow upon the mountain's flanks, careful cross-references to meteorological and solar activity (none of which correlated in any meaningful way). And, crucially, weaving through the cold data like threads of forbidden lore, he integrated the connections to Dyer's suppressed Antarctic report, highlighting the chilling, inescapable parallels in non-Euclidean structure, blasphemous biological strangeness, and the sheer, mind-numbing scale of the implied cosmic entities. Documenting the horror felt like the only means left to him to validate his own shattered experience, perhaps the only way to bestow some abstract, posthumous meaning upon the sacrifice he had not made, the rescue he had not attempted. It felt like the only thing he could offer the memory of the family he had abandoned in that resonant, accursed valley. He felt compelled to make the official record itself scream the unutterable truth, even if its cry fell upon ears deliberately deafened by fear and institutional denial.

He submitted the voluminous, dread-laden document, complete with its damning appendices and photographic plates, through the proper, labyrinthine channels of the Geological Survey. The initial reaction from his superior, Dr. Flett, a cautious, unimaginative man wedded to the comforting dogma of accepted geology, was one of profound, palpable discomfort. Flett grudgingly acknowledged the meticulous nature of the data collection, the undeniable existence of anomalies that defied facile explanation, but recoiled violently from Galloway's conclusions, particularly the explicit, heretical links drawn to the discredited Miskatonic expedition and the sanity-shattering implication of vast, sentient, geological life-forms. "Arthur," Flett had said, his voice strained, beads of perspiration appearing on his brow despite the coolness of the office, "this is... extraordinary, deeply unsettling material. But your interpretation... it borders on the... the fantastical, the morbid. We must proceed with extreme, unwavering caution."

Caution manifested itself first as silence, then as insidious obfuscation. The report vanished into the higher, shadowed echelons of governmental bureaucracy. Instead of rigorous scientific peer review, Galloway found himself summoned to a series of quiet, deeply unnerving meetings held in anonymous, wood-panelled chambers secreted within the vast Government Buildings, rooms far removed from the practical, earth-bound domain of the Survey. The men he met were polite, grey-suited spectres, their affiliations deliberately vague ("Coordinator's Office," "Internal Assessments," "Special Liaison"). Their questions circled elliptically, warily, around the terrifying core findings, focusing instead with unnerving intensity upon Galloway himself: his precise movements during the investigation, his mental state both during and after the ordeal, the perceived reliability of the Campbells (whose ultimate fate remained officially unconfirmed, eventually filed away under the euphemism 'missing persons following severe adverse weather event'), the precise source and extent of his illicit knowledge regarding the Dyer report, and, above all, his capacity for absolute discretion. They seemed less interested in the geological data (the tangible proof of cosmic horror) than in the potential for societal disruption, for widespread panic, for unwelcome international scrutiny should such a terrifying story leak beyond their control. They appraised him coolly, dispassionately, professionally, assessing the risk he represented, the potential vector of contagion he embodied.

The final meeting was brief, almost perfunctory in its chilling finality. A senior, silver-haired figure, whose name Galloway never learned and whose face remained a shadowy enigma, delivered the official verdict with quiet, implacable, soul-crushing finality. "Mr. Galloway, your submitted report and the accompanying physical materials represent a matter of profound, ongoing national significance, requiring long-term assessment under stringent governmental control. The dedication you demonstrated under duress is acknowledged. However, given the... speculative, and frankly disturbing, nature of certain conclusions drawn, and the undeniable potential for public misinterpretation and widespread alarm, the findings will be classified at the highest possible level indefinitely. Your absolute, unwavering, and permanent discretion regarding all aspects of this matter is, naturally, mandated under the provisions of the Official Secrets Act and is considered a non-negotiable condition of your continued public service. The matter is now considered irrevocably closed."

The implicit threat hanging in the sterile air needed no crude elaboration. Galloway understood with dreadful clarity. The silence imposed wasn't merely procedural; it was absolute, suffocating. Whether these shadowy figures genuinely believed in the slumbering entity or merely feared the societal chaos its potential existence represented, the outcome for him, for the truth, was identical. His silence was demanded, enforced. For Galloway, it felt like a second burial: first, the hideous truth about the entity hidden beneath Mount Arrowsmith, and now, this official entombment of his findings, compounding the gnawing, ever-present guilt over the spectral fate of Margaret and Ian Campbell. He made tentative, discreet inquiries through old university contacts, scanned provincial newspapers for any oblique mention of incidents at Station Peak, but found only an echoing void. They had vanished utterly, swallowed first by the indifferent mountains and then by the subsequent, calculated silence of the state.

His career, once holding a modest promise, withered and died. Back within the familiar yet now stifling confines of the Survey, colleagues treated him with a careful, wary politeness that spoke volumes. Meaningful fieldwork assignments evaporated, replaced by tedious archival research into matters long settled, or the drafting of mundane reports on known, innocuous mineral deposits. He felt the distinct chill of professional ostracism, sensing the unspoken consensus that Galloway had perhaps 'cracked' under the pressure of high-country isolation and loneliness, his mind succumbing to fanciful delusions. The stifling atmosphere, combined with his own ceaseless internal turmoil (the phantom echoes of the resonance, the recurring nightmares of impossible geometries and Margaret's desperate face) became unbearable.

He eventually sought early retirement in the late 1940s, removing himself as far as geographically possible from the brooding ramparts of the Southern Alps, settling in a small, isolated bach overlooking the deceptively placid turquoise waters and somnolent, bush-clad hills of the Marlborough Sounds. He filled his empty days with voluminous reading: history, obscure physics, speculative philosophy, comparative mythology, endlessly, fruitlessly searching for patterns, for context, for any shred of understanding that might help him comprehend the incomprehensible, abyssal thing beneath Mount Arrowsmith and reconcile his own actions on that terrible night. He avoided geology with a visceral aversion, shunned all academic circles. He became a quiet, solitary, spectral man, haunted by the phantom sensation of a subsonic hum that sometimes seemed to mock him in the throb of a distant boat engine or the mournful sighing of the wind in the macrocarpa trees, and by faces forever seared into his memory, glimpsed in moments of ultimate terror: Margaret's desperate, futile courage, Ian's wide, uncomprehending eyes, Donald's vacant, horribly illuminated stare. He would stand for hours gazing out at the indifferent sea, but his inner gaze remained fixed upon distant, unseen, menacing mountain horizons, forever burdened by the terrible, suppressed knowledge the New Zealand government had chosen to bury deep within its secret, subversive heart, and the enduring, private, corrosive shame of his own survival. His part in the dreadful narrative was concluded, but the echoes of his choices, and the abyssal resonance from the mountain, remained, a permanent, festering wound upon his soul.

## Chapter 4: The Sepulchral Vaults Beneath Wellington

Deep within the reinforced concrete catacombs threading beneath Wellington's corridors of mundane power, far below the chambers where politicians debated ephemeral budgets and civil servants drafted memoranda destined for oblivion, the air hung cool, dry, and unnaturally still. It carried the faint, dusty odour of aging paper, of subterranean concrete, and the subtle, metallic tang of the humming ventilation system that fought a ceaseless, losing battle against the inherent, sepulchral chill of the earth. Mr. Abernathy, a meticulous Records Clerk whose late forties had bleached all colour from his suit and temperament alike, proceeded along the dimly illuminated Corridor Epsilon, his regulation black footwear producing soft, rhythmic taps upon the polished concrete floor: the sole sound disturbing the profound silence, save for the low, omnipresent thrum of the building's unseen, vital machinery.

His destination was Vault Gamma-Psi, a designation appearing upon no public schematic or architectural plan. Reaching it necessitated navigating a bewildering warren of identical-seeming passages, past numerous heavy steel doors, each bearing a small, stencilled label hinting at the strange, uncomfortable, or inconvenient truths sequestered within this restricted, subterranean stratum of governance. His security clearance, hard-won through years of unimpeachable discretion and rigorously maintained, granted him passage here, a grim privilege afforded to exceedingly few souls within the sprawling bureaucracy.

He walked past a portal labelled **"Psychical Research Unit (Archival Records)"**; its thick steel expanse sealed with an imposing red wax governmental stamp declaring its contents 'Dormant – Access Level Omega'. The Unit itself, Abernathy recalled from hushed departmental lore, had been officially disbanded in the early 1920s following some unspecified, disastrous 'incident' involving field experiments gone hideously awry, yet its potentially dangerous records clearly remained under the strictest interdiction. Further on, a reinforced vault door marked **"Pre-Polynesian Māori Survey (Artefacts \- Unverified Origin)"** suggested repositories containing relics stubbornly refusing assimilation into accepted archaeological chronologies: adzes of obsidian and argillite flakes, and cleanly severed moa shank bones found beneath the Taupō (Hatepe) Ash Layer; red-haired skeletal remains exhibiting anomalous, giant, disturbing morphologies; rocks bearing unsettling Celtic inscriptions hinting at migrations and peoples history preferred to ignore, consigning them to the realm of myth or madness.

As Abernathy continued down the main corridor towards the next grim junction, another clerk from Records Division Four, a Mr. Davies as grey and unobtrusive as Abernathy himself, emerged from a side passage shrouded in shadow. Davies propelled a standard-issue, rubber-wheeled records trolley, but its freight was concealed beneath a drab, heavy canvas sheet. Despite this covering, the unmistakable, jumbled contours of human skulls and long bones pressed gruesomely against the fabric: ancient, brittle-looking artefacts, yellowed with time, some trailing desiccated crumbs of dark, peaty soil or pale, coastal sand. Davies offered Abernathy a barely perceptible nod, his features a perfect mask of professional neutrality, as he guided the trolley towards a heavy steel door further down, marked with chilling simplicity **"Disposal Unit 3 \- Incinerator"**. A faint, acrid chemical odour (perhaps accelerant) momentarily tainted the stale air before the efficient ventilation system greedily whisked it away into oblivion. Abernathy returned the nod with equal impassivity, his mind methodically registering the action without judgment or undue curiosity: Davies evidently handling the final, irrevocable 'de-accessioning' of the problematic North Kaipara skeletal finds, artefacts recently deemed 'historically unstable' and 'paradigm-incompatible' by some shadowy, unseen committee whose directives filtered down from heights unknown. Such disposals, Abernathy understood from hushed, fearful departmental whispers, were sometimes deemed necessary for the preservation of comforting historical narratives. He continued on his appointed way without breaking stride, consciously compartmentalizing and erasing the unsettling image of ancient bones destined for fiery annihilation.

He passed another portal labelled **"Anomalous Zoological Reports"**, a particularly thick repository whose very designation conjured brief, unwelcome mental flashes from cover sheets glimpsed furtively over years of dutiful filing: blurry, ambiguous photographs of monstrous shapes glimpsed in the remote, mist-shrouded Fiordland Sounds; plaster casts of unidentifiable, deeply clawed tracks discovered near isolated West Coast settlements; soberly transcribed eyewitness accounts of 'Taniwha' encounters treated with chilling, analytical seriousness by investigators long since retired, transferred, or perhaps silenced by other means. Around a final, bleak corner, a sterile corridor designated **"Southern Ocean & Antarctic Phenomena (Restricted Assessments)"** branched off, its vaults presumably holding far more than mere meteorological data or prosaic whaling ship logs: conceivably containing unprocessed, disturbing, intercepted reports from Byrd's later expeditions, or disquieting follow-up notes pertaining to the ill-fated, infamous Miskatonic voyage and the horrors it purportedly uncovered.

Abernathy registered these fleeting sights and resonant labels with the same impassive diligence he applied to his daily filing tasks. His function was not to question the provenance, veracity, or potential horror of the materials entrusted to these subterranean vaults, merely to process, secure, and systematically forget them according to draconian protocols designed to protect the fragile sanity of the surface world. He finally reached the dead-end corridor housing Vault Gamma-Psi, identified solely by the stark Greek letter Ψ stencilled beneath the official alpha-numeric coding, a symbol hinting at unknown quantities or psychic disturbances.

Inside, under the stark, unwavering glare of bare electric bulbs that banished all comforting shadows, rows upon rows of heavy, grey steel filing cabinets stood like silent, grim sentinels in the profound, echoing silence. Abernathy paused before a specific cabinet, distinguished from its fellows only by a small, coded label reading 'NZGS \- ANOM REG Ѱ' (New Zealand Geological Survey \- Anomalies Register \- Psi classification). He operated the complex dual locks (a tumbler mechanism requiring a precise, memorized combination, followed by the insertion and turn of a heavy, uniquely cut key) with practiced, deliberate movements honed over years of trusted, unquestioning service.

With a low groan of well-oiled metal runners, the top drawer slid open, revealing its densely packed contents. It was nearly full. Abernathy's gaze, professionally trained to maintain utter detachment, nonetheless swept over the serried ranks of folders with a flicker of something almost akin to weary, morbid recognition. Some folders were decades old, their paper yellowed and brittle as ancient parchment, tied with faded legal ribbon, grim relics from colonial surveys or early scientific explorations that had stumbled upon things best left undisturbed in the primordial darkness. But his eyes lingered, maybe unconsciously, maybe guided by a deeply suppressed sense of unease bordering on dread, on the section designated for the last ten to fifteen years: the late 1920s and these current, increasingly troubled 1930s. This section was significantly, disturbingly more crowded than all the earlier decades combined. Folder after folder bore recent dates, recent classification stamps, testament to a world growing increasingly thin, increasingly permeable to the monstrous and the inexplicable...

With precise, almost ritualistic care, Abernathy slotted the new file he carried (thick, heavy, bound in plain, unadorned manila, labelled with stark simplicity *'Geological Survey Special Project 7B: Anomalous Resonant Phenomena, Station Peak Valley / Mt Arrowsmith Region, Canterbury High Country Survey, A. Galloway, 1937'* and stamped with the chillingly long 75-year embargo period) into its designated position amongst the silent, terrible company of its fellows: documents detailing inexplicable lights observed wheeling in night skies, strange coastal disappearances leaving no trace, unsettling archaeological finds defying human history, biological impossibilities dredged from abyssal depths. He made a brief, neat notation in the heavy, leather-bound access ledger lying open upon a nearby steel table: date, file code, his own insignificant initials. The task was complete.

He felt no unprofessional urge to peek inside Galloway's report, nor any of the other sleeping horrors entombed within this cabinet. Curiosity was a dangerous, actively discouraged luxury in these sunless depths. Yet, as he closed the heavy drawer, the locking mechanism engaging with a solid, echoing **thunk** that seemed to be absorbed instantly by the thick concrete walls, Abernathy couldn't entirely suppress that fleeting, unwelcome thought: the cold, dry, statistical observation concerning the undeniably, alarmingly accelerating rate at which this particular cabinet, the one designated to hold the records of the truly inexplicable, the fundamentally disruptive, the potentially world-shattering, seemed to be filling up in recent times. He secured the locks with final, decisive clicks that sounded unnaturally loud in the stillness, turned, and walked back through the silent, secret corridors towards the distant, mundane world above, the faint, acrid memory of the incinerator barely registering against the immense, chilling, psychic weight of the forbidden knowledge locked away in the cold, dark, unknowing depths beneath the nation's capital.

The End.
