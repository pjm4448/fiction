# The Forgotten Astronomer

---

**Summary**

In the fog-choked village of Wraith's End, astronomer Samuel Whitlock, haunted by the loss of his wife Miriam, uncovers a sinister cosmic secret. Drawn to a forbidden tome, the Caelum Profundis, and guided by Miriam’s eerie relics, he unravels a chilling truth: her disappearance was no accident but part of an ancient pact with abyssal forces. As he aligns the lighthouse to summon the malevolent Y'thar, reality frays, and Miriam returns—transformed, monstrous, and bound to the stars’ dark will. In a desperate act, Samuel destroys the tome, shattering the ritual but not the looming dread.

In the accursed township of Wraith’s End, where the fog wreathed the decrepit habitations like a phantasmal cerement woven from the reveries of submerged deities, there lingered a miasma of decay and primordial dread. This blighted hamlet, festering upon the rugged coast of Massachusetts in the year 1928, exhaled a noisome effluvium of brine and corruption. Its denizens—furtive fishermen with unwholesome visages and an unnerving similarity in their wide, unblinking stares—muttered of “ill-omened tides” whilst shunning the cyclopean lighthouse that loomed upon the precipitous cliffs. In the village square, a grotesque effigy, carven with piscine features and polished by clandestine caresses, glared with malefic intent. There, in a dome of tarnished brass, dwelt Samuel Whitlock, an astronomer of fifty winters, his countenance gaunt. The memory of his lost consort, Miriam, who vanished amidst a tempest five years hence, was a constant, gnawing presence, her parting whisper an enigma: “The stars summon.” He felt her absence as a physical ache, a hollowness that the salt-laced wind seemed to keen through. He often recalled her final months: a subtle shift in her gaze towards the sea; a strange, melodic humming that seemed to echo the rhythm of the tides; a newfound fascination with the more obscure, unsettling constellations he sometimes studied, her fingers tracing their impossible angles on his charts with a knowing, almost reverent touch. More troubling were the fleeting moments of profound, inexplicable sorrow he’d seen in her eyes when she thought him unobserving, a shadow that passed as quickly as it came, often after her long gazes seaward or her quiet humming of melodies that seemed to hold no human joy. He once found her clutching a piece of strangely carved driftwood, her knuckles white, a single tear tracing a path down her cheek before she hastily wiped it away, her smile strained when she noticed him. "Just the sea air, my love," she'd murmured, but her eyes held a depth of conflict he hadn't understood until it was far too late.

Once, Samuel had discoursed at Miskatonic University. His erudite expositions on celestial aberrations had initially earned him acclaim, then suspicion, and finally, derision. His postulations on non-Euclidean geometries glimpsed in the voids between distant galaxies, and his carefully worded hypotheses about patterns in cosmic radiation that hinted at sentient, planet-sized entities whose existence dwarfed human understanding, had first intrigued, then horrified his more orthodox colleagues. Cast out as a visionary heretic, he sought solace in Wraith’s End, where Miriam’s affection had briefly illuminated his exile. Now, he languished in his observatory, a sepulchre of reminiscence, strewn with crumbling charts, his own familiar telescope of corroded bronze, and her relics: a necklace of coral that sometimes seemed to emanate a faint, sub-audible thrum against his skin; a shawl still holding the faint, unsettling scent of the deep sea mixed with her familiar lavender; a daguerreotype wherein her smile, once a beacon, now seemed to widen into a chasm threatening the fragile veneer of his sanity. He also kept a small, locked coffer of her letters, unopened since her departure, and a peculiar, smooth grey stone she’d found on the beach, etched with a spiral pattern that sometimes seemed to shift under his gaze. He recalled her strange, melodic humming, a resonant, almost sub-audible thrumming that seemed to vibrate in sympathy with this very stone, a sound that now, in retrospect, felt less like a melody and more like an ancient, unsettling frequency. Once, he’d found her weeping silently, clutching the stone, muttering, "It demands too much," before quickly composing herself, offering a strained smile and a dismissive wave of her hand.

Venturing to the tavern for necessaries, he endured the baleful gazes of the townsfolk, their eyes—glittering like those of abyssal denizens—uncomfortably recalling Miriam’s own in her final days. He'd sometimes catch snippets of their hushed conversations, tales of the "Old Ones' pact" and the "gifts of the deep." An old, gnarled mariner named Jedediah Crane, his face a roadmap of storms, often watched him from a shadowed corner, a knowing, mournful look in his eyes. Once, as Samuel passed, Crane had muttered, just loud enough to be heard over the tavern’s murmur, “The pacts demand their due, Professor. The old blood always answers the call from the deep, and from the stars they mirror. Some doors, once opened by that blood, can drown the world.” The words, cryptic and unsettling, clung to Samuel like the ever-present mist. A matron, clutching an infant with disturbingly membranous digits, hissed as he passed, “Avert thine eyes from the firmament, Whitlock\! Some doors are best left unopened.” Her words, sharp as fish hooks, pierced him, a fresh wound salted by his profound solitude. He found himself increasingly poring over local histories in the dusty, neglected town archives, seeking any rational explanation for the pervasive strangeness, for Miriam's transformation before her disappearance. He found unsettling sketches in the margins of old ledgers – piscine humanoids, complex spiral patterns identical to the one on Miriam's stone, and repeated references to a "Veil" between worlds, a "whispering darkness" that sought entry. More disturbingly, he unearthed fragmented genealogies of the town’s founding families, including Miriam’s, riddled with oblique mentions of 'sea-gifts,' 'sacred duties to the tides,' and generations marked by an unnerving affinity for the deep, often culminating in 'walks into the ocean from which they did not return.' One brittle document spoke of the lighthouse’s construction, not merely as a beacon for ships, but as a 'ward' or 'anchor,' its light specifically angled to 'countervail certain influences from the void,' a peculiar phrasing that resonated with his own astronomical knowledge of celestial alignments and their potential, if esoteric, gravitational or energetic effects. The text hinted that its precise orientation was crucial for 'maintaining a delicate equilibrium.'

Upon a night of unwonted clarity, the stars burning with an almost aggressive brilliance, a vision assailed him: Miriam, her orbs aglow with the phosphorescence of nethermost gulfs, beckoned toward the lighthouse. He awoke with a gasp, the air in his room thick and cold. Her necklace, lying on his nightstand, emitted a faint, sickly sweet odor alongside its rhythmic luminescence. A compulsion, cold and insistent, gripped him, overriding his fear, his grief. He found himself dressing, moving as if in a dream, and traversing the mist-enshrouded cliffs. The lighthouse’s nethermost chamber, inundated with brine warm as the lifeblood of antediluvian titans, concealed a relic beneath mouldering timbers: a tome, swathed in oilskin, its integument slimy as the hide of some submarine leviathan. The *Caelum Profundis*, its nomenclature searing his intellect, bore sigils that seemed to writhe under his gaze. As his fingers reluctantly brushed its surface, a sensation like an icy burn shot up his arm, and a wave of nausea, profound and visceral, washed over him. He recoiled, a choked cry escaping his lips. This was no mere book of forgotten lore; its pages felt thin as shed skin, and the script seemed to shift and squirm if stared at too long, hinting at a consciousness bound within the very ink and parchment. He wanted to hurl it into the sea, to cast it into the deepest fissure of the cliffs, but the necklace on his breast tightened, a cold pressure against his sternum, a counterpoint to the tome’s palpable malevolence, an undeniable command urging him forward. With trembling hands, he carried it back to his observatory, the thing radiating a subtle, bone-chilling cold.

For days, the tome lay upon his desk, a source of dread and a perverse fascination. Twice, he attempted to destroy it. The first time, he tried to burn it in his stove, but the flames recoiled, hissing, leaving the slimy cover untouched, the air suddenly filled with an odor of ancient, stagnant water. The second, he carried it to the cliffs, intending to cast it into the raging surf, but as he raised his arm, the necklace constricted, a band of icy fire around his neck, while the tome itself seemed to grow impossibly heavy, anchoring him to the spot until the impulse passed, replaced by a wave of profound, unnatural calm and the renewed urge to understand its secrets. He tried to cover it, to lock it away in a heavy iron-bound sea chest, but the compulsion, amplified by the incessant, insistent pressure of Miriam’s necklace against his skin, and the subtle, insidious whispers that now seemed to slither from the tome’s closed pages like unseen tendrils, grew unbearable. Sleep offered no escape, only visions of the tome’s sigils burning behind his eyelids, interspersed with fragmented memories of Miriam chanting in a low, resonant tone—a tone chillingly similar to the thrumming he associated with her spiral stone—her eyes fixed on some distant, unseen point beyond the horizon. He would awaken, sweating and trembling, the urge to open it a physical clawing in his gut. "This is madness," a part of his mind, the rational astronomer, the grieving husband, screamed. "Miriam is gone. This... this is a relic of some forgotten, debased cult. It promises nothing but delusion." He tried to cling to the image of Miriam as she was – her laughter, the warmth of her hand in his, the shared quiet evenings. He paced his study, reciting astronomical facts, laws of physics, anything to anchor himself to the world he knew. He even attempted to write a letter to a former colleague at Miskatonic, a desperate plea for… he knew not what. But the ink wouldn't flow for such a purpose; his hand would tremble, and the words would become disjointed, meaningless. The whispers, seemingly emanating from both the tome and the necklace, intensified, promising answers, promising *her*, twisting his grief into a tool for their insidious purpose. Finally, with a groan that was half surrender, half despair, he opened it. Within, a chart delineated the Veil of Y’thar, a constellation alien to all known cosmography, its lines writhing like the cogitations of a deranged cosmos. A chilling recollection stirred—Miriam, by the sea’s marge, her voice unnaturally resonant, intoning a cacophonous strain, its cadence mirrored in the tome’s blasphemous, silent susurrations that now seemed to echo in his mind. He remembered her sketching similar, though cruder, star charts in the sand, charts whose disturbing accuracy he had dismissed as fanciful, but which now mirrored the tome's unholy diagrams with horrifying precision.

He knew the lighthouse possessed an old, powerful telescope in its lantern room, a relic from a previous keeper rumored to have shared his own unorthodox celestial interests. It had lain disused for decades. Now, under the tome's insidious guidance and the necklace’s relentless urging, a frantic energy seized him. The tome itself, when he'd finally succumbed to opening it further, had revealed a chilling passage detailing how the lighthouse's original warding energies, tied to its precise orientation and the specific crystalline structure of its great lens, could be 're-attuned' or, more accurately, perverted. The 'delicate equilibrium' the ancient texts spoke of was, according to the *Caelum Profundis*, a lock waiting for the correct key to twist it from a shield into a gateway. For days, he toiled, not in his familiar observatory, but in the lighthouse peak, cleaning lenses thick with salt and grime, adjusting ancient, corroded mechanisms. It was as if another will guided his hands, his own expertise twisted to serve an alien purpose. He fought against the impulse, a knot of dread tightening in his stomach, the knowledge that he was dismantling a protective structure, however esoteric, gnawing at his sanity. But the necklace on his chest burned with a cold fire, and the tome, which he now carried everywhere, seemed to radiate a palpable, almost gleeful hunger. With each adjustment to the ancient mechanisms, each careful polishing of the lens according to the tome's unholy diagrams, he felt a subtle shift in the lighthouse's atmosphere – a weakening of some unseen barrier, a growing coldness that had nothing to do with the sea air. The very light that passed through the lens seemed to bend differently, the ambient hum of the structure changing from a protective resonance to a low, expectant thrum that vibrated deep within his bones. With a sigh that surrendered to the inevitable, he aligned the lighthouse telescope to the Veil’s coordinates, the final act in corrupting the ward into a beacon. The lens of the ancient instrument seemed to ripple, its usually clear glass distorting as if the very fabric of space it peered through was being warped by an unseen gravity. Therein he beheld not stars, but eyes—unblinking, malignant, glaring from a void where temporality was a mockery. Whispers, as of a drowned multitude, permeated the chamber, echoing Miriam’s voice, now seductive, now commanding: “Gaze deeper, beloved.” His journal burgeoned with frenzied annotations, its pages defiled by sketches of spirals and lidless countenances, wrought in somnambulistic fervour. Yet, interspersed between these mad scribblings were passages of chilling lucidity, scrawled in a desperate, shaking hand: *"October 17th: I am perverting the lighthouse. The ancient ward… I can feel it breaking. The air itself feels… thinner, colder. What horror am I unleashing? The necklace is a brand. I cannot stop."* And later: *"October 19th: Saw her in a dream again, not Miriam, but the thing she has become. It wears her face. It commands. I tried to smash the lens today, but my own hands turned against me, striking my own face until I desisted. I am a prisoner in my own body."* The telescope’s lens remained subtly contorted, a permanent scar upon the glass, forever attuning it to the abyssal vistas it had unveiled. Even when not in use, a faint, almost imperceptible hum emanated from it, and on moonless nights, the very air around the eyepiece seemed to shimmer with faint, impossible colours, a conduit for whispers from beyond. The chamber grew dank, brine seeping where no ocean could intrude, the scent of it cloying and ancient. The necklace scorched his breast with an unholy chill, its coral pulsing as though imbued with unhallowed life. He tried to resist, to pull away, but the visions it sent were too potent, too alluringly terrifying.

His slumbers were plagued by visions of a sunken metropolis, its spires—graven with visages that wailed in mute agony—defying Euclidean precept. Miriam presided there, her flesh agleam with squamous lustre, her eyes radiant with the Veil’s verdant malevolence. He awoke, his visage in the cracked speculum pallid, his eyes distended, the reflection seeming like that of a stranger. Driven by a gnawing terror and a desperate need for understanding, he sought out Jedediah Crane at the tavern, the mariner’s earlier words now echoing with dreadful significance. Crane, finding Samuel wild-eyed and trembling, led him to a quieter, more secluded spot by the docks, amidst the scent of tar and drying nets.

“Thou hast looked, haven’t ye?” Crane rasped, his voice heavy with generations of ingrained fear. “The Veil. She led ye to it, same as she was led.” He gestured with a hand that bore faint, web-like traces between the fingers. “My lad lies abed, coughing brine, for thy sacrilege. The Veil stirs, and the Old Night will follow if it fully wakes.” Crane leaned closer, his breath smelling of salt and something older. "As you might have gleaned from those old records, Professor, we are the descendants of those who made pacts, for protection… and for lineage. That book you found," he nodded knowingly, "the *Caelum Profundis*… it was their offering to the deep, and in turn, became their most potent curse. Its power is immense, a direct conduit to realms beyond. For generations, we believed that leaving it undisturbed, bound by certain rituals and the lighthouse's specific alignment as a ward, somehow kept the worst at bay—a desperate hope it acted as a kind of seal. But its true nature is that of a key, Professor, a key that only turns one way. To open it, to decipher its rites, especially to re-align a structure like the lighthouse from a ward to a beacon, is to unlock the door and invite the very horrors it describes." Crane’s eyes, ancient with sorrow, met Samuel’s. "You ask why I didn't do more? Professor, I *tried*. When my own father began to succumb, when he started speaking of the 'songs from the dark water,' I attempted to destroy our family's copy of that damned book. It nearly took my life, and the backlash… it struck my boy. The influence is too deeply woven into this place, into our blood. We can only endure, and pray the Veil remains just that—a veil, not a gaping maw. The whispers of Y'thar are not meant for mortal ears, nor its gaze for mortal eyes. Its destruction might disrupt a specific summoning, a ritual in progress, but the gate it showed you remains, and Y'thar's attention, once drawn, is not easily diverted. We've tried to keep the influence dormant, sacrificing our peace, our normality, to avoid stirring the abyss. But your… curiosity… your Miriam… she was always a lightning rod, more so than most. The sea-blood, that 'affinity for the deep' you read about in her family's history, ran strong in her line, a tragic inheritance making her an ideal instrument for such a tome." Samuel recoiled, haunted by a litany he vaguely recalled from the town's debased, sea-facing chapel, its verses—redolent of Miriam’s chant—proclaiming, “From the depths, the stars ascend.” The townsfolk, he now dimly perceived, were not merely swayed by Miriam; they were her kin, bound by blood and ancient covenants to the abyssal powers she served, some willing, some, like Crane, burdened by a terrible duty.

The Veil waxed effulgent, its sickly green radiance a wound in the celestial vault, perceptible now even to the most oblivious souls in Wraith’s End. The tides grew perverse, surging at unnatural times, piscine life forsook the nets, and the fog thickened with a pervasive piscine fetor, as if the sea itself exhaled a portent of doom. Samuel, driven by a desperate need to understand the abyss he had opened, deciphered more of the tome. He learned the Veil was a psychic fetter for Y’thar, a Great Old One immured in a stellar abyss, whose very dreams could curdle reality. Annotations, in Miriam’s sinuous, familiar script, prescribed a rite to unshackle the entity. Crane’s words, the fragmented histories from the archives, Miriam's unsettling humming, her intense fascination with those dark constellations, her eerily accurate sketches in the sand – it all coalesced into a dreadful, undeniable pattern. She hadn’t just been influenced; she had been *aware*, perhaps even from the start of their life in Wraith's End, or before, a participant in this unfolding horror. A cold dread, deeper than any he had known, settled in his heart. He thought of Crane’s words, of the generations struggling against this. Had Miriam known all along? He finally forced himself to open the coffer of her letters. Among them, one, dated shortly before her "disappearance," was particularly chilling. It spoke not in confession, but with a cold, almost detached clarity: "The call is absolute now, Samuel. The deep sings my true name, the only name that ever mattered. What I am becoming is what I was always meant to be; what I must do is inevitable. The stars they show me... they are not *your* stars. Do not seek forgiveness, for it is irrelevant. You will follow the path I set for you." The words, devoid of any discernible human emotion, confirmed his deepest fears with brutal finality. Miriam was no simple victim, but a willing agent, her past affection a calculated, chillingly effective lure, her parting a strategic step in a horrifying design. Her demise was a staged exodus to her true kin, leaving the necklace as a conduit for her cold machinations, a leash for his soul. Every shared memory, every perceived tenderness, now felt like a meticulously crafted illusion. The fleeting expressions he'd mistaken for sadness, or the conflict he thought he'd glimpsed, were perhaps nothing more than the alien workings of a mind utterly beyond his comprehension, or the subtle shifts of a predator observing its prey, allowing just enough perceived vulnerability to draw him closer. The question of her being a pawn vanished; she was a player, aligned with the terrifying game. The cosmic despair threatened to consume him whole.

The lunar eclipse impended, the Veil’s verdant blaze rending the fog, casting Wraith's End in an apocalyptic glow. Samuel, his mind a maelstrom of terror and a burgeoning, desperate defiance that was swiftly being crushed, found himself ascending the winding stairs of the lighthouse. The tome felt like a block of ice in his satchel, the necklace a throbbing, parasitic weight against his hammering heart. Each step was an agony, his limbs heavy, his will eroded by the incessant whispers that urged him to surrender, to complete the ritual. The astronomer who sought truth in the stars, not madness, was a fading echo. The warnings in the archives, the lighthouse's original purpose as a ward – these thoughts were now distant, overwhelmed by the tide of alien influence. *This is not discovery,* a small, dying voice screamed within him, *this is desecration\! I am a tool, a damned fool\!* The cliffs quaked, the sea below seething with phosphorescent forms—grotesque amalgams of man and fish, their shared ancestry with the townsfolk now hideously apparent, their voices a chorus of guttural blasphemies that clawed at the air. Below, the matron he’d seen in the village wailed, her child’s cough a liquid, gurgling lament, while an elder prostrated before the piscine effigy in the square, beseeching salvation from a god that was also their progenitor, its stone eyes seeming to gleam in the unholy light.

The lighthouse’s uppermost sanctum, where he had restored the ancient telescope, now unveiled a shrine: an altar of glistening black coral and osseous relics, Miriam’s sea-stained shawl draped thereupon, redolent of submarine decay and a faint, lingering trace of her lavender. She emerged from the gloom, no longer the woman he knew, her mortal guise sloughing away like a shed skin. Scales shimmered with an oily iridescence upon her transforming flesh, her eyes blazed with the green fire of the Veil, her voice a gurgle from the deepest trenches of the abyss. “Thou hast beheld the stars, beloved,” she intoned, the sound vibrating in his very bones. “Thou hast prepared the way. Thou hast summoned Him.”

Samuel reeled, the tome clutched tight against his chest, though his grip was weakening. “Miriam… No. What have you become?” he croaked, tears of grief and horror veiling her monstrously beautiful form. “Our years together… was it all deception? That letter… were those words true?”

Miriam’s webbed claw, reaching for the tome, paused, a flicker in her blazing emerald orbs that was not sorrow, but perhaps a cold, alien calculation, or the briefest registering of a tool performing its function. “Thy devotion was… useful, Samuel. It anchored you to the path I laid. It served Y’thar. And it served *me*.” Her voice, a guttural rasp from the deepest trenches, held no trace of the cadence he had cherished, only the chilling resonance of the abyss. Any warmth he had perceived was a phantom, a reflection of his own desperate hope against the void she embodied.

The restored telescope stood aimed at the Veil. Through its scarred lens, Y'thar's single, lidless orb pulsed, a malevolent sun in a dying universe. Its scrutiny was a physical weight, a pressure that threatened to pulverize his intellect. Y’thar’s thoughts, cold and vast, inundated him, a cacophony of aeons, of realities born and consumed. His blood shrieked in protest, his sanity frayed like an old rope. The town below crumbled, habitations engulfed as the sea surged with unnatural hunger, the elder’s supplications drowned in a final, bubbling cry.

His soul shattered, a precipice of madness yawning before him. Y'thar’s orb pressed, demanding, consuming. The psychic assault was unbearable; his mind felt like it was being flayed, his will scoured away. The implanted commands were absolute. A primal terror, the last vestige of his dissolving self, sparked a final, violent convulsion through his frame. His hands, no longer his own, fumbled at his chest, tearing at the searing, burrowing presence of the necklace not in reasoned defiance, but in mindless, instinctual agony. With a choked gurgle, a sound of pure animal terror as his consciousness frayed, he ripped it from his throat. It flew from his spasming grasp, striking the stone floor and shattering into a dozen dull, lifeless fragments.

The sudden cessation of the necklace's direct, localized influence, while the overwhelming psychic torrent from Y'thar continued unabated, sent his body into a violent, uncontrolled paroxysm. He stumbled, reeling, his limbs flailing with the brute force of a puppet whose strings were tangled in a catastrophic storm. Miriam lunged, a guttural shriek tearing from her throat, her squamous form agleam, her eyes blazing with furious possessiveness, fixed on the *Caelum Profundis* still clutched in Samuel’s trembling, unresponsive hands. "The offering\!" she hissed, her alien hunger overriding all else.

The lighthouse itself, caught in the vortex of Y'thar's burgeoning presence, gave a tremendous, stone-splintering shudder. As Miriam’s taloned hand shot out, not for Samuel, but for the tome, her lunge coincided with Samuel’s violent, uncontrolled spasm and the tower’s violent heave. Her claws raked across Samuel’s arm, drawing blood, her impact jarring the *Caelum Profundis* from his nerveless grip. It was not mere clumsiness on her part, but a confluence of Samuel's final, agonized convulsions, her desperate lunge, and the lighthouse's own structural torment. The tome spun through the air, its trajectory wild and unpredictable, striking the edge of the now-tilting profane altar and tumbling directly into the heart of the flickering tapers.

Flames, initially reluctant as if fearing the unholy text, licked at the oilskin, then caught, erupting with an unnatural, green-tinged hunger. The sigils on the pages seemed to writhe and scream, a chorus of the damned wailing as the ancient power within was consumed. Miriam froze mid-lunge, her shriek dying in her throat, her webbed hands outstretched, watching the destruction with wide, unblinking eyes that reflected the inferno. A raw, alien frustration contorted her features as the offering burned. As the last page of the tome curled into ash and the final, glowing fragment of coral lay inert, a profound, shuddering change overcame her.

Her form flickered, the abyssal radiance in her eyes dimming, sputtering like a faulty connection being severed. No sound of sorrow escaped her, only a dry, sibilant hiss, like escaping gas from a deep fissure, as the energies animating her dissipated. The very substance of her being seemed to lose cohesion, her scaled flesh dissolving into a shimmering, saline mist that eddied for a moment with an almost palpable frustration, then was swiftly, inexorably drawn back towards the churning, enraged sea below, reclaimed by the cold, indifferent depths she served.

The lighthouse shuddered violently, stone fissured and groaned, the profane altar crumbling into a pile of glowing embers and dust. Samuel lay insensate upon the floor, the roar of the receding tide and the crackling flames a distant sound as the sea’s icy embrace seemed to claim the very foundation of the tower. The Veil above did not vanish, but its terrible luminescence pulsed, then slowly, almost imperceptibly, began to recede, its direct gaze shifting, as if an immense eye had merely blinked, its attention momentarily diverted but not extinguished, its hunger unsated.

Wraith’s End lay half-submerged, its remnant denizens mute, their forms subtly, irrevocably more piscine than before, the effigy in the square toppled but its shadow still long and dark in the faint, returning starlight. Weeks hence, a mariner—perhaps Crane, or one of his kin—retrieved Samuel’s journal from the debris-strewn shore, its pages warped and stained, its final coherent inscription a single, shaky scrawl: “Miriam. Forgive me.” A faint, squamous imprint, like a damp handprint, marred the cover. The fog, though thinner, still enshrouded all, yet those few who dared peer skyward, especially through glass that had once been touched by the abyss—like the scarred lens of the lighthouse telescope, now a lonely, silent sentinel in the ruins of the tower—glimpsed a verdant glimmer, faint as a moribund star, yet undeniably present, throbbing almost imperceptibly in the nocturnal abyss. It was a silent promise of Y'thar's eventual, inevitable return, and a chilling reminder that some gazes, once met, could never be truly broken.

The End.
