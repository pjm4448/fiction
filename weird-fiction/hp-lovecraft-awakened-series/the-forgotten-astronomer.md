# The Forgotten Astronomer

**Synopsis**

In 1928, astronomer Samuel Whitlock lives in exile in the decaying Massachusetts fishing village of Wraith's End, haunted by the disappearance of his wife Miriam five years prior and her cryptic final words: "The stars summon." When disturbing visions lead him to discover an ancient tome hidden beneath the lighthouse, Samuel becomes obsessed with deciphering its secrets, believing it holds the key to understanding what happened to his beloved wife. As he delves deeper into forbidden knowledge and aligns the lighthouse's telescope to impossible celestial coordinates, the astronomer begins to suspect that Miriam's vanishing was no mere tragedy but part of a cosmic design stretching back generations through her bloodline. With the boundaries between sanity and madness eroding, and the townspeople exhibiting increasingly disturbing fish-like characteristics, Samuel must confront the ghastly possibility that his wife's love was merely a carefully constructed lure, and that his grief has made him the unwitting instrument of forces that regard human existence with absolute and staggering neutrality.

---

In the accursed township of Wraith's End, where eldritch fogs wreathed the mouldering habitations like a phantasmal cerement woven from the fever-dreams of drowned gods, there festered a miasma most vile to the senses. The year of our Lord 1928 found this blighted Massachusetts hamlet exuding a noxious effluvium of corruption and pelagic decay that clung to the soul like verdigris upon ancient bronze. Its denizens, furtive fishermen with countenances of loathsome cast and an unsettling uniformity in their wide, unblinking stares, muttered in guttural tones of ill-omened tides whilst casting fearful glances toward the cyclopean lighthouse that loomed upon the precipitous cliffs like a monument wrought from blackened obsidian by hands unknown to mortal geometers. In the village square, a grotesque piscine effigy, carven with features that suggested some blasphemous congress betwixt man and the denizens of fathomless deeps, gleamed with the dark lustre of hematite, its surface polished to an obscene sheen by the clandestine caresses of nocturnal worship.

Samuel Whitlock, astronomer and exile, entered the dockside tavern seeking provisions, that low-ceilinged establishment wherein the reek of fish-oil and stale rum commingled with the perpetual damp. The salt-scarred mariner Jedediah Crane, his visage a veritable palimpsest of storms and sorrows, watched him from a shadowed corner with eyes that gleamed with an unhealthy luminescence, then approached with the deliberate steps of one bearing tidings of utmost gravity.

"Professor," Crane rasped, pausing while Samuel set down his parcels. The mariner's weathered hands gripped the table's edge, knuckles white beneath sun-darkened skin. "Some men seek the stars for truth."

Samuel's gaze lifted, wary. "A noble pursuit, surely."

"As moths are drawn to the flame that shall consume them." Crane's voice dropped lower, forcing Samuel to lean in despite himself. "But the cosmos, in its vast and ruinous neutrality, cares naught for human truth."

"I fail to see..." Samuel began.

Crane's hand shot out, not touching but stopping inches from Samuel's wrist. "It answers questions we were never meant to ask." His eyes, ancient with sorrows that predated his own mortality, fixed on Samuel with hideous knowing. "Shows us visions that corrode the very fundaments of sanity."

A muscle twitched in Samuel's jaw. His parcels forgotten.

"Your wife." The words hung between them like an axe blade. "She learned that bitter knowledge, didn't she?"

Samuel's breath caught audibly. His hand moved involuntarily to his chest, where beneath his shirt the coral necklace rested.

Crane pressed forward, relentless. "Before she walked into the sea's embrace as so many of her line have done before." He leaned closer still, his breath reeking of brine and older things, of depths where light has never penetrated and horrors dream in stygian cities. "The stars summon, aye, but what comes when they are answered is not salvation, Professor."

"That is quite enough..." Samuel managed, but his voice cracked.

"'Tis the ending of all we know." Crane's whisper carried weight beyond volume. "The unravelling of reality's merciful veil."

Samuel recoiled as though struck, clutching his parcels with white-knuckled desperation. The table scraped against the floor as he backed away. "Miriam's disappearance was a profound tragedy, nothing more."

"Was it?" Crane's question hung unanswered.

"I'd thank you not to speak of matters beyond your understanding." But even Samuel heard the hollowness in his own words, the desperate clinging to a version of events his heart no longer believed.

Crane straightened slowly, resignation settling over his features like a funeral shroud. His expression remained grave as a sepulchre's portal. "I comprehend more than you credit, Professor." A pause, weighted with meaning. "We all do, in this tide-cursed haven."

He turned as if to leave, then looked back over his shoulder. "Mind yourself when you gaze upward at night, Professor Whitlock. Some gazes, unfathomable and malign, look back from gulfs of space and time beyond all human reckoning."

The mariner's footsteps retreated into shadow, leaving Samuel alone with his parcels and his rapidly disintegrating certainties.

Samuel retreated with all haste to his observatory, that dome of tarnished brass which perched upon the cliff's edge like some great metallic eye perpetually fixed upon the vault of heaven. His countenance bore the ravages of fifty winters, gaunt and drawn by a grief that gnawed at his vitals with the persistence of some parasitic thing. Miriam, his lost consort, had vanished five years hence amidst a tempest of such fury that even the hardened fishermen spoke of it in hushed and fearful tones. Her parting whisper, those three words that had become the axis upon which his sanity rotated with ever-diminishing stability, haunted him still: "The stars summon."

Once, in what now seemed another lifetime separated from the present by an unbridgeable gulf, he had discoursed at venerable Miskatonic University, that bastion of learning which stands in ancient Arkham. His erudite expositions on alien geometries glimpsed in the stygian voids between distant galaxies, and his carefully worded hypotheses concerning certain patterns in cosmic radiation that suggested sentient forces whose very existence dwarfed human understanding as a mountain dwarfs an ant, had earned him first acclaim among the learned, then suspicion from the orthodox, and finally derision most profound from those who dared not contemplate the implications of his discoveries. Cast out as a heretical visionary, a Galileo whose crime was seeing too much and too clearly, he had sought exile in Wraith's End, where Miriam's affection had briefly illuminated his isolation with a warmth that now seemed impossibly distant, a fading star in the ever-expanding darkness of his solitude.

Now he languished among crumbling star charts yellowed with age and her relics most unsettling: a necklace of coral that thrummed against his skin with a sub-audible resonance that set his very teeth on edge, its surface gleaming with the sickly luminescence of diseased amber or the eyes of certain deep-sea fishes; a shawl still retaining the intermingled scent of the lightless deep and her beloved lavender, though the former seemed with each passing day to overwhelm the latter; a daguerreotype wherein her smile, once the very emblem of domestic felicity, now seemed in certain lights to widen into a chasm suggestive of abyssal hungers. He kept also a locked coffer containing her letters, which he had lacked the fortitude to open since her departure, and a peculiar grey stone she had discovered upon the strand, its surface etched with a spiral pattern of such mathematical precision that it seemed to shift and writhe under prolonged scrutiny, as though the stone were but a window upon some rotating geometry in dimensions beyond the mortal ken. He recalled with increasing unease her strange humming in those final months, a resonant thrumming that seemed to vibrate in uncanny sympathy with this very stone, and her slender fingers tracing impossible constellations upon his charts with a reverent familiarity that suggested knowledge gleaned from sources he dared not contemplate.

Once he had discovered her weeping in the grey hours before dawn, clutching the stone with such fervid intensity that her knuckles had gone white as bone. "It demands too much," she had muttered in a voice not entirely her own, before composing herself with a smile so strained it seemed her face might crack like porcelain.

The townsfolk's baleful gazes reminded him uncomfortably of Miriam's own in her final days. Their whispered tales of the "Old Ones' pact" and "gifts of the deep" clung to him like the perpetual mist. He had begun researching the town archives, seeking rational explanations for the pervasive strangeness. He found unsettling sketches: piscine humanoids in ritual ecstasy, spiral patterns identical to Miriam's stone, repeated references to a "Veil" between worlds. More disturbing were the fragmented genealogies, including Miriam's ancient lineage, riddled with mentions of sea-gifts, sacred duties to the tides, and ancestors who walked into the ocean never to return.

One brittle document described the lighthouse's construction not merely as a beacon for ships, but as a ward, its light specifically angled to countervail certain influences from the void. The text hinted that its precise orientation maintained a delicate equilibrium between worlds.

Upon a night of unwonted clarity, when the stars burned with an aggressive brilliance that seemed to mock the insignificance of terrestrial concerns, a vision of such unnerving vividness assailed his slumbers: Miriam, her eyes no longer the warm brown of mortal woman but aglow with a phosphorescence drawn from nethermost gulfs where nameless things writhe in eternal darkness, beckoned toward the lighthouse with a gesture that was at once achingly familiar and utterly alien in its implications. He awoke with a strangled gasp that echoed through the empty observatory. The air lay thick and gelid as grave-earth freshly turned, pressing upon his chest with almost palpable weight.

Her necklace, lying upon his nightstand like some malign talisman, emitted a cloying odor reminiscent of flowers blooming in charnel grounds, alongside a rhythmic luminescence that pulsed with the regularity of a heartbeat, though it was assuredly the heartbeat of something long drowned and abiding still in depths beyond human fathoming. Its coral beads possessed an opalescent sheen that shifted with nauseating fluidity through colours that had no names in earthly languages. A compulsion, relentless and insistent as the embrace of death itself, gripped him with fingers that seemed to reach into the very core of his being. He found himself dressing in movements automatic and dreamlike, then traversing the mist-enshrouded cliffs with steps guided by an intelligence wholly not his own, a puppeteer that pulled strings woven from his own grief and desperate longing.

The lighthouse's nethermost chamber, that subterranean vault which lay below even the foundation stones, stood inundated with brine warm as the blood of antediluvian titans. There, concealed beneath mouldering timbers that crumbled at his touch into substance more akin to corrupted flesh than honest wood, lay a relic that his soul knew at once for a thing of uttermost evil: a tome swathed in oilskin blackened with ages beyond counting, its surface possessed of a sliminess reminiscent of the hide of stygian leviathans. The *Caelum Profundis*, the Depths of Heaven, or perhaps more accurately, the Heavens of the Deep. The very nomenclature seared his intellect like a brand of white-hot iron pressed against grey matter. Sigils that hurt the eye to perceive writhed upon its covers with obscene vitality, as though the binding itself were composed of living tissue.

As his reluctant fingers brushed its surface, a sensation like unto an icy burn, paradoxical and agonizing, shot up his arm with the speed of lightning through a rod. Profound nausea, the very fundaments of his being rebelling against what he touched, washed over him in waves. He recoiled with a choked cry of revulsion. Yet even in his recoiling, he understood with stark clarity that this was no mere grimoire of forgotten lore. Its pages felt thin as the shed skin of serpents, and the script seemed to shift and squirm beneath his gaze if he dared stare too long, hinting at a consciousness bound within the very ink and parchment, a malevolent sentience that had survived aeons of imprisonment and now sensed its liberation drawing nigh. He wanted with every rational fiber of his being to hurl it into the sea, to cast it into the deepest fissure of the cliffs where it might trouble the world of men no more. But the necklace upon his breast tightened with a pressure cold as the void between stars, a clamp about his sternum, commanding him forward with a compulsion as irresistible as the tides themselves.

With hands that trembled so violently he could scarce maintain his grip, he carried the accursed thing back to his observatory, feeling it radiate a bone-chilling cold that seemed to seep into his very marrow and settle there like hoar-frost upon tombstones.

For days that stretched into a phantasmagoria of waking nightmare, the tome lay upon his desk, radiating an aura of dread compounded with perverse fascination that seemed to warp the very air about it into distorted geometries. Twice, with mounting desperation that bordered upon frenzy, he attempted to destroy the accursed thing. Upon the first occasion, he tried to burn it in his stove, feeding the flames until they roared with furnace heat. Yet the flames recoiled as though possessed of sentience and fear, hissing like serpents faced with some greater predator, leaving the slimy cover wholly untouched whilst the air filled with an odor of ancient, stagnant water drawn from pre-Cambrian abysses where the first stirrings of life had taken forms mercifully unseen by modern eyes. Upon the second attempt, he carried it to the precipitous cliffs with the intention of casting it into the ravening surf far below, where the sea's eternal churning might drag it down to depths from whence nothing returns. But as he raised his arm to hurl it forth, the necklace about his throat constricted with such violence that his vision dimmed and his breath rattled in his constricting windpipe, whilst simultaneously the tome itself seemed to grow impossibly heavy in his grasp, as though it had become a block of lead or perhaps contained within its covers the concentrated mass of some collapsed star. He stood thus, frozen betwixt intention and inability, until the murderous impulse passed and was replaced by a calm so unnatural, so utterly divorced from the tumult of his emotions, that he knew it for an imposed thing. With that false serenity came a renewed and intensified urge to penetrate the tome's secrets, to decipher what blasphemous knowledge lay encrypted within its pages.

Sleep offered no respite from his torment, no blessed oblivion wherein he might forget for even a few hours the doom that drew ever nearer. Instead, visions of the tome's sigils burned behind his eyelids like brands of molten metal pressed against the soft tissue of his brain, interspersed with fragmented memories of Miriam chanting in tones that resonated with frequencies no human throat should produce, her eyes fixed with fervid intensity upon distant, unseen points beyond the horizon, beyond perhaps the very curve of space itself. He would awaken in his narrow bed drenched in perspiration cold as corpse-dew, the urge to open the tome manifesting as a physical sensation, a clawing in his gut as though some parasitic thing had taken up residence in his viscera and demanded to be fed.

"This is madness," that part of his mind which yet remained rational screamed with ever-diminishing strength, like a man drowning who makes one final desperate cry before the waters close over his head for the last time. "Miriam is gone, lost beyond all mortal retrieval. This thing promises naught but damnation, the shattering of sanity and the dissolution of self." He tried with piteous desperation to cling to his memories of her as she had been: her laughter like silver bells in summer, the warmth of her hand in his as they walked the cliffs in happier times, their quiet evenings gazing at the stars whilst she asked questions about the cosmos with a curiosity he had thought innocent and charming. He paced the confines of his observatory until he had worn a visible path in the floorboards, reciting astronomical facts, laws of physics, mathematical formulae, anything that might anchor his fragmenting consciousness to the world of reason and natural law. He even attempted to write a letter to a former colleague at Miskatonic, a desperate plea for assistance or perhaps merely for human contact, but his hand trembled so violently that the pen tore the paper, and when he managed to form words at all they emerged as meaningless gibberish, a random concatenation of letters that mocked his deteriorating grip on language and thought.

All the while, the whispers emanating from tome and necklace intensified with each passing hour, sibillant voices speaking in languages that predated human speech, promising answers to questions he had never dared ask, promising *her*, the restoration of what he had lost. They twisted his grief with diabolical cunning, fashioning it into a tool for their insidious purpose, a hook by which they might drag him down into abysses from which no mortal returns with mind intact.

Finally, with a groan half surrender and half despair, he opened it with shaking hands. Within, a chart delineated the Veil of Y'thar, a constellation alien to all known cosmography. Its lines writhed like the cogitations of a deranged cosmos, each star marked with symbols that gleamed like black diamonds against an impossible void. A chilling recollection stirred: Miriam by the sea's edge, her voice unnaturally resonant, intoning a cacophonous strain. He remembered her sketching similar star charts in the sand, charts whose disturbing accuracy he had dismissed as fanciful but which now mirrored the tome's unholy diagrams with horrifying precision.

Driven by a terror that gnawed at his sanity like rats at a corpse, and by a desperate need for understanding that overrode all caution, Samuel sought out Crane at the tavern. He found the mariner at the docks, that place where sea met land in an uneasy truce, mending nets by lamplight amidst the fused scents of tar, drying kelp, and the ever-present stench of fish in various stages of decay. Crane took but one look at Samuel's wild eyes, red-rimmed and starting from his skull like those of a man long sleepless, and at his hands that trembled with a palsy no medicine could cure, then led him without a word to a quieter spot where the lapping of black water against rotting pilings provided a rhythmic counterpoint to their discourse.

"Thou hast looked upon it, haven't ye?" Crane didn't wait for an answer. His gaze fixed on Samuel's chest, where the necklace rested beneath fabric. "The Veil of Y'thar."

Samuel's hand moved involuntarily to cover the spot. "How could you?"

"She led ye to it." Crane's voice carried certainty beyond questioning. "As surely as the condemned is led to the gallows. Same as she was led by those who came before her."

"You speak as if..." Samuel began, but the words died in his throat.

"As if I know?" Crane held up a weathered hand, spreading the fingers slowly. In the lamplight, faint web-like traces between the digits gleamed with an oily sheen. "We are all of us marked here, Professor. Some more than others."

Samuel stared at the webbing, unable to look away. "That's impossible. A birth defect, surely."

Crane's laugh was bitter. "Aye, a defect born into us before our fathers' fathers drew their first breath." He lowered his hand. "My lad lies abed even now. Coughing up brine."

"The boy is ill?" Samuel's concern was automatic, human, breaking through his horror for a moment.

"Though he hath not set foot in the sea these three months past." Crane's eyes found Samuel's, held them. "Tell me, Professor, how doth a child drown on dry land?"

The question hung unanswered. Samuel's mouth opened, closed.

"'Tis thy sacrilege that ails him." The accusation came soft, which made it worse. "The Veil stirs. Like some great beast disturbed in its aeon-long slumber." Crane leaned forward suddenly, grabbing Samuel's shoulder with surprising strength. "And the Old Night shall follow if it fully wakes."

Samuel tried to pull back. Crane's grip tightened.

"Generations, Professor." The mariner's breath came hot against Samuel's face. "Generations we have kept watch. Kept the balance." His voice dropped to barely above a whisper. "We are descendants of those who made pacts in ages past."

"Superstition," Samuel managed, though his voice shook. "Folklore. There must be a rationa..."

"Rational?" Crane released him with such suddenness that Samuel stumbled. "Ye want rational? That book ye found, the *Caelum Profundis*. Tell me how it survived centuries in salt water without rotting. Tell me how flames recoil from it. Tell me," his voice rose, "tell me what rational explanation exists for thy wife sketching constellation charts that match diagrams in a book she never saw, in a language she never learned!"

Samuel had no answer. The truth of it struck him like a fist.

Crane saw the realization dawn and his fury collapsed into something worse. Despair. "It was their offering to the deep, Professor. A covenant." He sank onto a piling, suddenly looking every one of his years. "For protection from the tempests. For lineage that endures when other bloodlines wither."

"But why?" Samuel found himself asking. "Why make such a bargain?"

"Because our ancestors were drowning." Crane's voice went flat, reciting history like a dirge. "Because the sea wanted to claim this place, and they were desperate men who would do anything, promise anything, to survive." He looked up at Samuel. "And survive they did. We all did. But the price?"

"What price?"

"Everything." The single word carried weight beyond measure. "The book is not protection, Professor. It was never so. Its true nature is that of a key."

Samuel felt the necklace pulse against his chest, as if responding to the word.

"A key that turns but one way." Crane rose slowly, facing Samuel directly. "Once turned, it can never be returned to its original position. To open it, to decipher its rites, is to unlock the door that should remain forever sealed."

"Then why didn't you destroy it?" Samuel's voice rose, defensive, desperate. "If you knew, if your people have always known, why leave it where someone could find it?"

The question hung between them. Crane's weathered face worked, emotions warring across it. When he finally spoke, his voice cracked. "Ye ask with the privilege of the educated man who thinks himself above the superstitions of simple fisher-folk." A pause, heavy as a tombstone. "Why I didn't do more to prevent this?"

"Yes," Samuel pressed. "Why didn't you destroy the book before I could find it?"

Crane's eyes went distant, seeing something far away or long ago. "When mine own father began to succumb to the call, when he started speaking in the small hours of the night of the songs from the dark water..." He stopped, swallowed hard. "I attempted in my youth and foolish courage to destroy our family's copy of that thrice-damned book."

Samuel waited, barely breathing.

"It nearly took my life, Professor." Crane's voice dropped to a whisper more chilling than any shout. "I was abed for half a year. Raving about things that crawled up from the deep trench beyond the shoals."

"But you survived," Samuel said, not understanding. "You..."

"Aye, I survived." Crane's face twisted with grief. "And the backlash from that attempt, the psychic recoil of forces I cannot name, it struck my boy in my stead."

Understanding dawned like ice water down Samuel's spine. "Thomas."

"Afflicting him with maladies no doctor of this earth can name or treat." Tears gleamed in the corners of Crane's eyes, unshed. "The influence is too deeply woven into this place. Into our blood where it runs thick with saltwater and with essences drawn from depths primordial. Into the very stones upon which this accursed town is built."

Samuel's legs felt weak. He groped for support, found the rough wood of a piling.

Crane's expression hardened again, tears swallowed back by iron will. "Thy curiosity, Professor. Thy Miriam." He stepped closer. "She was a lightning rod for forces that sought entry into our world. The sea-blood ran strong in her line. Stronger perhaps than in any born here these hundred years."

"She was human," Samuel whispered. "She was..."

"She was an ideal instrument." Crane's words cut like knives. "A perfect vessel for that which wishes to be born anew into flesh."

Samuel recoiled as though struck, his mind reeling with implications that shattered what remained of his carefully constructed understanding of reality like a hammer brought down upon glass. He was haunted suddenly by a litany he but vaguely recalled from the town's debased chapel, that low structure of stone gone green with lichen that the villagers attended with more regularity than any church of Christ: "From the depths, the stars ascend. From the stars, the depths descend. What is above is below. What is below shall rise." The townsfolk were not merely swayed by Miriam's influence, he understood now with sick certainty. They were her kin, bound by blood and by ancient covenants to the stygian powers she served, a congregation of the damned awaiting their terrible apotheosis.

The lighthouse possessed an old, powerful telescope in its lantern room, a relic from a previous keeper who had vanished under mysterious circumstances. It had lain disused for decades. Now, under the tome's insidious guidance and the necklace's relentless urging, frantic energy seized him.

The tome revealed a chilling passage detailing how the lighthouse's original warding energies could be re-attuned, perverted into something abominable. The delicate equilibrium the ancient texts spoke of was a lock waiting for the correct key to twist it from a shield into a gateway.

For days, he toiled in the lighthouse peak, cleaning lenses thick with salt and grime, adjusting ancient, corroded mechanisms with fevered determination. It was as if another will guided his hands, his expertise twisted to serve an alien purpose. He fought against the impulse, knowledge that he was dismantling a protective structure gnawing at his sanity. But the necklace burned with gelid fire, its coral beads pulsing with rhythms that made his heart stutter in sickening sympathy.

With each adjustment to the ancient mechanisms, each careful polishing according to the tome's unholy diagrams, he felt a subtle shift in the lighthouse's atmosphere: a weakening of some unseen barrier, a growing coldness that had nothing to do with sea air. The very light that passed through the lens seemed to bend differently, the ambient hum changing from a protective resonance to a low, expectant thrum that vibrated deep within his bones.

His journal burgeoned with frenzied annotations, its pages defiled by sketches of spirals and lidless countenances, wrought in somnambulistic fervour. Yet interspersed were passages of striking lucidity: *"October 17th: I am perverting the lighthouse. The ancient ward, I can feel it breaking. The air itself feels thinner, colder. What horror am I unleashing?"* And later: *"October 19th: Saw her in a dream again, not Miriam, but the thing she has become. It wears her face. It commands."*

His slumbers were plagued by visions of a sunken metropolis, its spires defying standard precept, their surfaces encrusted with barnacles that gleamed like twisted pearls in submarine gloom. Miriam presided there, her flesh agleam with squamous lustre, her eyes radiant with the Veil's verdant malevolence. He would awaken, his reflection in the cracked mirror pale and distended, a stranger possessed.

With a sigh that was at once surrender to the inevitable and the final exhalation of his former self, the death-rattle of the rational astronomer who had once walked the halls of Miskatonic in blessed ignorance, he aligned the lighthouse telescope to the Veil's coordinates with hands that had grown steady in their damnation. This was the final act in the perversion of the ward's purpose, the transformation of shield into beacon, of guardian into betrayer. The lens of that ancient instrument, ground by hands unknown in ages past, seemed to ripple before his eyes as though it had transmuted from solid glass into something more akin to viscous liquid, its substance distorting as if space itself warped and buckled under the gravity of some unseen presence pressing against the thin membrane that separated dimensions.

Therein, through that corrupted lens, he beheld not the familiar stars that had been his life's study, not the distant suns and spiral nebulae that had once filled him with wonder and the joy of discovery. Instead, he gazed upon eyes, unblinking and malignant beyond all mortal conception, glaring from a void where temporality was but a cruel mockery and sanity a forgotten luxury of organisms too primitive to comprehend the true nature of existence. They were eyes of such monstrous size that galaxies might orbit within their pupils, eyes that saw not merely across space but through the very fundaments of reality, perceiving past and future as a child perceives the pages of a book spread before it. Whispers as of a drowned multitude permeated the chamber, voices that gibbered in proto-human gutturals and sang in frequencies that caused his bones to ache and his teeth to buzz in their sockets. And threading through that cacophony like a silk ribbon through coarse burlap came Miriam's voice, now seductive as the song of sirens that lured sailors to their doom, now commanding as an empress addressing her thralls: "Gaze deeper, beloved. See what you have always been meant to see."

For one harrowing moment, a span of heartbeats that seemed to stretch across aeons, triumph surged within his breast. He had succeeded where all others had failed. He had found her. The Veil had answered his desperate plea. She was there, waiting in the depths between stars, in the interstices of reality where normal matter dared not venture, and now he could reach her, understand what she had become, perhaps even join her in that transformation.

But as Y'thar's single lidless orb pulsed through the lens with the rhythm of some great and formidable heart beating in dimensions askew to our own, a malevolent sun in a dying universe whose light brought not illumination but a darkness visible, Samuel understood the truth with a clarity that ground what remained of his sanity into dust as surely as the tide grinds a shell. This was no rescue. This was doom. He had not found Miriam. He had not achieved any victory, false or true. He had merely done precisely what he was always meant to do, had followed the path laid out for him with the inevitability of a marble rolling down a groove carved for its passage. He had summoned something infinitely worse than his wildest nightmares could have conjured, had thrown wide the gates to horrors that should have remained forever locked beyond the pale of human knowing. And Miriam, his beloved Miriam, had always meant for him to do precisely this. She had been the bait, and he the fish that swallowed the hook, line, and sinker entire.

The telescope's lens remained subtly contorted, a permanent scar upon the glass, forever attuned to abyssal vistas. Even when not in use, a faint hum emanated from it. On moonless nights, the air around the eyepiece shimmered with impossible colours, a conduit for whispers from beyond known spheres.

The chamber grew dank, brine seeping where no ocean could intrude. The necklace scorched his breast with unholy chill, its coral pulsing as though imbued with unhallowed life, a parasite feeding on his dwindling will.

The Veil waxed effulgent with each passing night, its sickly green radiance a suppurating wound in the celestial vault, perceptible now even to the most willfully oblivious of souls in Wraith's End, pulsing with the malign luminescence of radioactive jade or the foxfire glow of corpses in advanced putrefaction. The very tides grew perverse in their movements, surging at hours contrary to all astronomical calculation and with a hungry malevolence that seemed almost sentient, as though the sea itself had developed a malign consciousness and sought to drag the land down into its frigid embrace. Aquatic life forsook the nets in their terror, fleeing to depths unknown, whilst from those same depths arose creatures thought long extinct or perhaps never catalogued by science, things with too many eyes and appendages that seemed to shift between states of matter as they writhed upon the strand. The fog thickened with each dawn until it possessed the consistency of curdled milk, and through it wafted a pervasive fetor, a reek of fish and stygian decay interfused with something worse, something that suggested charnel pits and mass graves, as if the sea itself exhaled the concentrated essence of doom.

Samuel's corporeal form began to fail him in ways both subtle and grotesque. His skin grew pallid and clammy to the touch, taking on a faint, unwholesome sheen in certain lights that called to mind the bellies of deep-sea fishes or the pale and bloated flesh of things too long submerged. He coughed brine despite never entering the water, expectorating mouthfuls of salt water that burned his throat and left a taste of copper and decay upon his tongue. His fingers cramped into claws when he tried to write anything save the tome's translations, and even then the handwriting that emerged seemed not his own but the script of something ancient and malevolent using his hand as its instrument. The necklace, which he could no longer bring himself to remove, had burned a permanent brand into the flesh of his chest, the coral's spiral pattern now etched into his very skin as though his body were merely wax into which a hot seal had been pressed. In his most lucid moments, he could feel the pattern pulsing in time with his heartbeat, or perhaps it was his heartbeat that had been enslaved to pulse in time with the pattern.

Sleep offered no respite from his torment, only deeper and more visceral horrors that seemed to seep into his waking hours like ink spreading through water. The dreams intensified with each sunset until he could no longer reliably distinguish between sleeping visions and waking reality. He saw not merely Miriam's sunken city, those cyclopean spires that jutted from abyssal plains like the fingers of titans clawing toward a surface they would never reach, but legions of her kindred, whole bloodlines of the transformed and the transforming, waiting in the depths with a patience born of aeons. They called to him with her voice, with a hundred voices, with a thousand, a chorus that promised him reunion in the cold embrace of Y'thar's gaze, transformation into something greater than his pitiful human flesh, an escape from the prison of individuality into the glorious collective consciousness of the deep.

Worse still were the waking visions. The townspeople's faces shifted when he passed, their piscine features becoming more pronounced, their eyes gleaming with forbidden knowledge. A matron clutching an infant with membranous digits hissed at him: "Avert thine eyes from the firmament, Whitlock! What lies beyond will devour all."

Crane's son died, drowning in his own bed, his lungs filled with seawater that had no earthly source. The mariner came to Samuel's observatory, and Samuel knew the moment he saw the man's face that something had broken beyond all repair.

Crane stood in the doorway, not entering, as though some invisible threshold prevented him. His weathered face was grey, slack. When he spoke, his voice was barely audible. "Thomas drowned last night."

Samuel's hand, which had been tracing sigils in the tome's margin, went still. "Jedediah, I..."

"In his bed." Crane's voice grew louder, stronger. "In his bed, Samuel. Not at sea. Not in the harbor. In his bed where I tucked him in and kissed his forehead and told him I loved him." Each word came harder, faster. "His lungs were full of seawater. The physician couldst not explain it. Said it was impossible. But it happened."

Samuel rose from his desk, reaching out. "I am deeply..."

Crane's hand shot up, palm out, stopping him. "Nay." A stifling pause. "Nay, thou dare not offer condolences. Not thee. Not when this is because of thee."

The accusation struck Samuel like a physical blow. "That is..."
"The Veil hungers because of what thou hast done." Crane took a step into the room, then another, each movement carrying barely contained violence. His voice broke on the next words. "It takes our children first. The innocent. The ones who've done naught, know naught, who never asked to be born into this cursed place with this cursed blood." Tears carved channels through the salt-stains on his cheeks. "Then it shall take us all."

Samuel backed against his desk, the tome pressing into his spine. "I never intended..."

"Intention?" Crane's laugh was a harsh, broken sound. "Thou thinkest the abyss cares about intention? Thou thinkest whatever's crawling up from the deep gives a damn about the noble pursuits of science?" He closed the distance between them in two strides, grabbing Samuel's collar with hands that shook. "Canst thou stop it, Professor? Canst thou?"

Their faces were inches apart. Samuel could smell the grief on the man's breath, sharp and sour.

"Canst thou undo what thou hast wrought?" Crane's voice dropped to a whisper more sinister than any shout. "Tell me thou canst save them. Tell me my boy didn't drown choking on salt water from nowhere for *naught*."

Samuel's mouth opened. Closed. The words caught in his throat like fishhooks.

Crane searched his face, desperate, and in that searching, found his answer. The hope died in his eyes. His hands released Samuel's collar, falling to his sides as though all strength had fled them. "Thou canst not. Of course thou canst not."

He turned toward the door, moving like a man three times his age.

"Jedediah," Samuel managed, his voice cracking. "Please. I..."

"Nay," Crane said without turning back. "Whatever thou art about to say, nay. There are no words. There never were."

The door closed behind him, softer than before, which somehow made it worse.

Samuel stood alone in the observatory, his collar askew, his hands trembling. The tome lay open on his desk behind him. Even now, even in this moment of stark clarity, he could hear it. The whispers. The promises. The final ritual. The lunar eclipse approaching. The moment when Y'thar could fully manifest.

His hand moved to the coral necklace at his throat. It pulsed warm against his palm, eager. Hungry.

He had no answer for Crane. But the tome did.

Driven by desperate need to understand, Samuel deciphered more of the tome with feverish intensity. He learned the Veil was a psychic fetter for Y'thar, a Great Old One immured in stellar abyss, whose very dreams could curdle reality and whose waking would unmake existence itself. Annotations in Miriam's sinuous script prescribed a rite to unshackle the entity from its cosmic prison.

Crane's words, the fragmented histories, Miriam's humming, her sketches: it all coalesced into a ruinous, undeniable pattern. She hadn't just been influenced. She had been aware, perhaps from the start, a participant in this horror rather than its victim.

A cold dread deeper than the Mariana Trench, more profound than the gulfs between galaxies, settled in his heart like a stone carved from primordial ice. He thought of Crane's words, of generations struggling against this cosmic tide like swimmers battling a riptide that would inevitably drag them down to drown in lightless depths. Had Miriam known all along? Had every moment of their years together been theatre, a carefully orchestrated performance designed to lead him to this very juncture?

He finally forced himself to open the coffer of her letters with hands that trembled so violently he could scarce work the lock. The key seemed to resist his efforts, as though even inanimate metal conspired against this revelation. Among the letters, yellowed with age and smelling faintly of that cloying lavender and salt, one dated shortly before her disappearance was particularly chilling in its implications. It spoke not in the tones of confession, not with the anguish of one trapped by forces beyond her control, but with a cold, detached clarity that suggested not a human woman writing to her beloved but rather some alien intelligence wearing human concerns as a poorly-fitted mask:

"The call is absolute now, Samuel. I can resist it no longer, nor do I wish to, for in truth I have never wished to resist. The deep sings my true name, the name that was inscribed in my cells before ever I drew breath in this terrestrial realm, the only name that has ever truly mattered. What I am becoming is what I was always meant to be, what my bloodline has been groomed across centuries to become. What I must do is as inevitable as the tides themselves, as certain as the procession of the equinoxes, as inexorable as entropy. The stars they show me, beloved, they are not *your* stars, not the familiar constellations by which mariners navigate or poets compose their feeble verses. They are the true stars, the cold and neutral orbs whose light carries madness and whose configurations spell out the doom of worlds in a language older than matter itself. Do not seek forgiveness, for such concepts are irrelevant, the conceits of a species that flatters itself with notions of moral agency and eternal souls. You will follow the path I have set for you as surely as the seabird is swept into the gale that shall destroy it. This is not prophecy but simple fact, as immutable as the laws of thermodynamics. I have enjoyed our time together as much as a being of my nature can enjoy anything in this limited flesh. Farewell, my dear Professor. We shall meet again, though not as you might hope or imagine."

The words, devoid of any discernible human emotion, devoid even of the mockery or cruelty that might at least have been recognisably human vices, confirmed his deepest fears with brutal and final clarity. Miriam was no simple victim of forces beyond her control, no innocent woman seduced by promises of forbidden knowledge. She had been a willing agent from the start, perhaps even before they had met in what he had believed was chance but now understood as calculated design. Her past affection, every kiss and caress and whispered endearment, had been a calculated lure, bait upon a hook fashioned in the abyssal depths. Her parting was but a strategic step in a horrifying design spanning generations, perhaps spanning back to the very founding of Wraith's End or beyond, to Old England or to shores even more ancient. Her demise had been no demise at all but a staged exodus to her true kin, those things that waited in the depths, leaving the necklace behind as a conduit for her cold machinations, a leash by which to lead him stumbling toward his appointed role in the opening of the way.

Every shared memory, every perceived tenderness, now felt like a meticulously crafted illusion. The fleeting expressions he'd mistaken for sadness were perhaps nothing more than the alien workings of a mind utterly beyond his comprehension, or the subtle shifts of a predator observing its prey.

She had never loved him. He had been a tool from the start.

Samuel collapsed at his desk with a cry that was half sob and half the keening of an animal caught in a trap from which there is no escape, the letter crumpling in his shaking fist until the paper tore and the ink smeared across his palm like accusatory stigmata. The cosmic despair threatened to consume him whole, to swallow his identity and dissolve his consciousness as surely as a drop of water dissolves in the ocean, becoming indistinguishable from the vast and ruinous whole. He wept, great racking sobs that echoed through the empty observatory and seemed to mock him with their impotence, tears that burned like vitriol as they coursed down his hollow cheeks.

He had given everything to Miriam. His career at Miskatonic, which had been the envy of younger scholars and the pride of the department. His reputation, laboriously built over decades of meticulous research and carefully worded papers. His very sanity, that fragile construct which he now understood had been crumbling for years, perhaps from the very day he had met her at that faculty reception where she had seemed so charmed by his discourse on stellar aberrations. He had followed her to this accursed place, this festering sore upon the New England coast, had endured the exile and the mockery of former colleagues who whispered that Whitlock had finally succumbed to the madness that lurked in his radical theories. All for love. All for a woman whose very existence had been a lie, a carefully crafted fiction designed to ensnare him as surely as a spider's web ensnares the fly.

And it had been precisely that: a lie. Every moment they had shared, every tender word whispered in the darkness, every shared evening gazing at the stars whilst he expounded on the wonders of the cosmos in his naive enthusiasm, all of it had been manipulation of the most diabolical sort. She had used him with the cold efficiency of a watchmaker selecting the precise gear needed for her infernal device, had employed his devotion and his desperate need for human connection as surely as the tome now used him, as surely as Y'thar used them both as instruments for its liberation from aeons of imprisonment.

He looked at the necklace where it lay upon his desk, its coral beads gleaming with a malevolent life that seemed to pulse in mockery of his anguish. He should destroy it, should grind it beneath his heel until naught remained but powder. He should flee this place with all the speed his aging legs could muster, warn others of the horror that approached with the inexorability of a tidal wave. He should do something, take some action that might redeem the ghastly mistake he had made. But what was the point? What could one insignificant man do against forces that had been old when the pyramids were young? Crane's son was dead, drowned in his own bed by forces that laughed at medical science. The town was doomed, had perhaps always been doomed from the day its first stone was laid by colonists who carried tainted blood in their veins. The Veil pulsed in the sky like an infected wound, a pustule upon the face of the heavens that would soon burst and release its corruption, and he had been the physician who lanced it, the fool who had opened what should have remained forever sealed.

He was insignificant, less than insignificant. An ant moving a single grain of sand upon a beach composed of all the beaches upon all the worlds orbiting all the stars in all the galaxies. The universe was vast beyond all human comprehension, cold beyond all human endurance, and utterly indifferent to human suffering in a way that was almost peaceful in its totality. Miriam had understood that fundamental truth. She had embraced it, had opened herself to it as a flower opens to the sun, had allowed it to transform her into something beyond the prison of human consciousness. And now Samuel understood it too, understood it with a clarity that seared through the tattered remnants of his sanity like lightning through a shattered tower.

The knowledge was poison more deadly than any concocted in an alchemist's retort. It would have been kinder, infinitely kinder, never to know, never to look up at the stars with anything more than childish wonder and the comfortable delusion that humanity mattered in some grand cosmic scheme. Truth, he now understood with bitter certainty, was not enlightenment as the philosophers claimed. Truth was damnation. Truth was the slow dissolution of all that made existence bearable. Truth was staring into the face of a neutral cosmos and understanding at last that you were alone, utterly alone, screaming into a void that would never answer save with the echo of your own despair.

He sat in the darkness as the hours crawled past with the sluggish pace of dying things, waiting for nothing because there was nothing to wait for, hoping for nothing because hope was a luxury afforded only to those who had not gazed too deeply into the abyss and found it gazing back with ancient intelligence. The astronomer who had sought to understand the cosmos, who had dedicated his life to the noble pursuit of knowledge, had finally succeeded in his quest. And the understanding had broken him as utterly and completely as a heavy blow shatters a frosted pane, leaving only shards that cut the hand foolish enough to try to gather them.

But as the lunar eclipse approached, as the Veil's verdant blaze rent the fog and cast Wraith's End in apocalyptic glow, something shifted in Samuel's shattered mind.

If he was damned, if Miriam was truly lost to the abyss, if the world itself teetered on the brink of cosmic annihilation, then he would face it. Not as a puppet dancing on alien strings, not as a tool in some incomprehensible design, but as a man who had looked upon the truth and survived long enough to witness its culmination.

He would go to the lighthouse. He would see Miriam, or the thing she had become. He would look upon Y'thar's final manifestation with his own eyes. And if the world ended, if sanity shattered, if reality itself unmade, at least he would know. At least he would understand the full scope of his damnation.

It was not defiance. It was not hope. It was acceptance of the only path left to him.

He rose from his desk, legs unsteady, and began the walk to the lighthouse with leaden steps.

The cliffs quaked. The sea below seethed with phosphorescent forms, grotesque amalgams of man and fish, their voices a chorus of guttural blasphemies. The matron he'd seen in the village wailed, her child's cough a liquid, gurgling lament. An elder prostrated before the ichthyic effigy in the square, beseeching salvation from a god that was also their progenitor.

Samuel ascended the winding stairs of the lighthouse, each step an agony. The tome felt like a block of ice in his satchel, the necklace a throbbing weight against his hammering heart. His will eroded with each whisper urging surrender.

The lighthouse's uppermost sanctum unveiled a shrine: an altar of glistening black coral and osseous relics, Miriam's sea-stained shawl draped thereupon, redolent of lightless decay and cloying lavender.

She emerged from the gloom like a nightmare given form and substance, no longer the woman he had known, had loved, had mourned. Her mortal guise had sloughed away like the shed skin of a serpent to reveal something far older and infinitely more formidable, something that had perhaps always lurked beneath the surface of her humanity like a skull beneath the skin. Scales shimmered with an oily iridescence upon her transformed flesh, catching what little light remained and refracting it into colours that had no names in any human language, hues that seemed to exist in spectra beyond the visible, colours that hurt the mind to perceive. Her eyes, once brown and warm as sun-baked sand, now blazed with the green fire of the Veil itself.

Samuel's legs nearly gave way beneath him. His breath came in short, desperate gasps.

"Miriam." The name escaped him as prayer and accusation both.

She tilted her head, the gesture almost familiar, almost human. "Beloved." Her voice was a gurgle drawn from the deepest abysses of the ocean, a sound that vibrated in frequencies that caused his bones to ache. Yet beneath the alien resonance, he caught something else. Recognition. "You've come at last."

"No." He shook his head violently, denying what stood before him. "No, this is... this is madness. A fever dream. The tome's influence."

"Is it?" She took a step closer. Samuel flinched back against the wall. "You've beheld the stars. You know what is real."

The tome pressed against his chest, burning cold through his shirt. His knuckles had gone white as bleached bone from gripping it. "What have you become?" The question came out broken. "What nightmare wearing your face stands before me?"

Something flickered in her blazing emerald eyes. Amusement? Pity?

"I have become what I always was," she said simply. "I've simply stopped pretending otherwise."

The words struck him like a blow to the sternum. He sagged against the lighthouse wall, his shoulders pressing into cold stone. "Our years together." Tears, hot and bitter, blurred his vision. "Was it nothing but deception from first to last?"

She moved closer. Not with menace, but with something worse. Patience. The patience of the tide. "Deception?" The word rolled strangely off her transformed tongue. "I shared your bed. I walked your gardens. I listened to your theories about stellar drift and cosmic velocities."

"But did you feel?" His voice cracked. "Did you ever feel even a shadow of what I felt? Did any of it matter to you?"

Silence stretched between them like a chasm. The lighthouse groaned around them.

Her webbed claw, the fingers elongated and tipped with chitinous talons that gleamed like polished obsidian, reached toward him. Not for the tome. For his face. Samuel froze, unable to retreat further.

The talons stopped a hair's breadth from his cheek. "Your devotion was," she paused, and for the briefest of moments, something almost human crossed her alien features, "useful, Samuel."

The word shattered something in him. He let out a sound between laugh and sob. "Useful."
"Yes." Her hand withdrew. "It anchored you to the path I laid as surely as an anchor holds a ship to its mooring."

"A tool." His voice was hollow now, emptied of all feeling. "I was nothing but a tool."

"You were," she corrected, her tone shifting from almost-tender to something colder, more alien, "what was needed. Your grief made you pliable. Your guilt made you desperate. Your love," she leaned closer, her breath cold and rank with brine, "your love made you blind."

Samuel's head snapped up, fury replacing despair. "How dare you?"

"I dare because it is truth." Her eyes blazed brighter. "You sought the stars for answers. I gave you the means. You sought me in the depths. I showed you the way." Her voice dropped to a whisper that somehow carried more weight than any shout. "It served Y'thar in His long dreaming. And it served me in my own purposes, which you cannot begin to fathom."

"Then tell me." The words came out as a desperate challenge. "Tell me what was so important that you would destroy everything we..."

"We?" She cut him off with a sound that might have been laughter. "There was no we, Samuel. There was only ever the plan, and you playing your part with admirable precision."

His hand tightened on the tome until the binding cracked. "Did you ever," he choked on the words, forced them out anyway, "did you ever love me at all?"

For a long moment, she simply stared at him with those unfathomable green eyes that held the light of drowned stars. When she finally spoke, her voice held no trace of the sweet cadence he had cherished through their years together, only the chilling resonance of the abyss given form and purpose.

"Love is a human conceit," she said. "I am no longer human. Perhaps I never was."

Her claw shot out, this time unmistakably reaching for the tome. "Now give me what I came for."

The restored telescope stood aimed at the Veil with unyielding precision. Through its scarred lens, Y'thar's single, lidless orb pulsed, an indifferent sun in a dying universe. Its iris was a swirling vortex of impossible colours: rubies bleeding into diseased emeralds, sapphires drowning in putrid amber, all spiraling into a central pupil blacker than obsidian. Its scrutiny was physical weight, pressure that threatened to pulverize his intellect into gibbering fragments.

Y'thar's thoughts, cold and vast, inundated him. A cacophony of aeons, of realities born and consumed in cycles beyond mortal reckoning. His blood shrieked in protest. His sanity frayed like old rope stretched beyond all limits.

His soul shattered, a precipice of madness yawning before him like the maw of some cosmic predator. The psychic assault was unbearable. His mind felt flayed, his will scoured away by forces that regarded human consciousness as less than dust. The implanted commands were absolute, inescapable.

A primal terror, the last vestige of his dissolving self, sparked a final, violent convulsion through his frame. His hands, no longer his own, fumbled at his chest, tearing at the searing, burrowing presence of the necklace not in reasoned defiance, but in mindless, instinctual agony born of animal desperation. With a choked gurgle, he ripped it from his throat with savage force. It flew from his spasming grasp, striking the stone floor and shattering into a dozen dull, lifeless fragments.

The sudden cessation of the necklace's direct influence sent his body into violent, uncontrolled paroxysm while Y'thar's overwhelming psychic torrent continued unabated. He stumbled, reeling, his limbs flailing with brute force.

Miriam lunged, a guttural shriek tearing from her throat, her squamous form agleam with unholy phosphorescence, her eyes blazing with furious possessiveness, fixed on the Caelum Profundis still clutched in Samuel's trembling hands. "The offering!" she hissed, her alien hunger overriding all else.

The lighthouse itself gave a tremendous, stone-splintering shudder, caught in the vortex of Y'thar's burgeoning presence. As Miriam's taloned hand shot out for the tome, her lunge coincided with Samuel's violent spasm and the tower's heave in catastrophic timing. Her claws raked across Samuel's arm, drawing blood that steamed in unnatural cold. The impact jarred the Caelum Profundis from his nerveless grip with brute force.

The tome spun through the air, its trajectory wild, striking the edge of a tilting profane altar where ritual candles burned with sickly green flames. The ancient book tumbled end over end, its oilskin binding catching on the altar's jagged coral edge before plunging directly into the heart of the flickering tapers.

Flames, initially reluctant as if fearing the unholy text, licked at the oilskin, then caught, erupting with unnatural, green-tinged hunger that consumed not merely paper but the very essence bound within. The sigils on the pages seemed to writhe and scream, a chorus of the damned wailing as ancient power was consumed by purifying flame.

Miriam froze mid-lunge, her shriek dying in her throat, her webbed hands outstretched in futile desperation, watching the destruction with wide, unblinking eyes that reflected the inferno with absolute comprehension. Raw, alien frustration contorted her features as the offering burned.

As the last page curled into ash and the final glowing coral fragment lay inert among the ruins, a profound, shuddering change overcame her with absolute finality.

Her form flickered, the abyssal radiance in her eyes dimming, sputtering like a faulty connection being severed by forces beyond mortal understanding. No sound of sorrow escaped her, only a dry, sibilant hiss like escaping gas from a deep fissure as the energies animating her dissipated into cold night air. The very substance of her being seemed to lose cohesion, her scaled flesh dissolving into a shimmering, saline mist that eddied for a moment with palpable frustration, then was swiftly, inexorably drawn back towards the churning, enraged sea below, reclaimed by the cold, neutral depths she served with such absolute devotion.

The lighthouse shuddered violently. Stone fissured and groaned under supernatural strain, the profane altar crumbling into glowing embers and dust. Samuel lay insensate upon the floor, the roar of the receding tide and crackling flames a distant sound as the sea's icy embrace seemed to claim the very foundation of the tower.

The Veil above did not vanish, but its baleful luminescence pulsed, then slowly, almost imperceptibly, began to recede, its direct gaze shifting, as if an immense eye had merely blinked, its attention momentarily diverted but not extinguished, its hunger unsated and eternal.

Wraith's End lay half-submerged beneath waters that had risen without benefit of storm or tide, its remnant denizens struck mute by horrors beyond all articulation, their forms subtly yet irrevocably more piscine than they had been before the Veil's opening, as though the very act of gazing upward had accelerated the transformation that had been creeping through their bloodlines across generations. The grotesque effigy in the square had toppled during the lighthouse's collapse, yet its shadow remained long and dark upon the flood-waters even in the returning starlight, as though the thing itself possessed a weight and substance independent of its material form.

Weeks hence, when the waters had receded somewhat and left behind a rime of salt upon every surface, a mariner whose name is perhaps best left unrecorded retrieved Samuel's journal from the debris-strewn shore. Its pages were warped and stained with salt and with worse things, substances that might have been ink or might equally have been ichor drawn from no earthly creature. Its final coherent inscription, scrawled in a hand that trembled with palsy or perhaps with something beyond mere physical infirmity, was a single plea: "Miriam. Forgive me." The cover bore a faint, squamous imprint not unlike the damp handprint one might leave after handling a fish, save that the appendage that left this mark possessed a configuration of digits wholly unlike any human hand.

The fog, though thinner than it had been in living memory, still enshrouded all, a perpetual reminder of mysteries that lurked just beyond the veil of perception. Yet those few souls who dared to peer skyward in the dead of night, especially those foolish or cursed enough to look through glass that had once been touched by the abyss and forever bore the invisible taint of that contact, glimpsed a verdant glimmer in the northern quadrant of the heavens. Faint as a moribund star in its final throes, yet undeniably present to those with eyes trained to see it, it throbbed almost imperceptibly in the nocturnal void with a rhythm that suggested not death but slumber, the slow breathing of something vast beyond all mortal reckoning.

It was a silent promise of Y'thar's eventual and inevitable return, patient as the stars themselves, inexorable as entropy. A chilling reminder writ across the cosmos that some gazes, once met across the staggering gulfs that separate dimension from dimension, could never be truly broken, but would endure until the last star guttered out and the universe itself collapsed into the final darkness from which nothing, not even Great Old Ones, could escape.

The End.
