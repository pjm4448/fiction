# **The Petrification of the Sublime: An Exhaustive Critical Analysis of "The Garden of Final Moments" in the Context of Zothique and the Weird**

## **I. Introduction: The Twilight of the Real and the Aesthetics of Entropy**

The short story "The Garden of Final Moments" presents a rich, multi-layered text that demands a rigorous critical interrogation, situated as it is at the intersection of high fantasy, the decadent movement, and the philosophical inquiries of the "Weird." Set against the backdrop of Clark Ashton Smith's Zothique—a "dying earth" where the sun has bloated to a crimson pustule and the laws of reality have begun to fray—the narrative explores the transmutation of grief into art, the collapse of the subject-object distinction, and the terrifying allure of the inorganic.1

This critical analysis aims to exhaustively deconstruct the text through thirty-three distinct lenses of literary and weird fiction criticism. It posits that "The Garden of Final Moments" is not merely a pastiche of the Zothique cycle but a sophisticated engagement with the ontology of art. By tracing the protagonist Calantha's journey from a weaver of representations to a cultivator of realities, the story argues for a "weird materialism" where the ultimate aesthetic goal is not the imitation of life, but the *becoming-object* of the self—a petrification into the sublime.

The report is structured to guide the reader through the concentric circles of the text's meaning: beginning with the macro-cosmic setting of the Dying Earth, moving inward to the psycho-geography of the Garden, analyzing the specific symbols of the Black Lily and the Statue, and finally arriving at the philosophical core of cosmic nihilism and anti-catharsis.

**II. The Eschatology of Zothique: Setting, Time, and Genre**

### **1\. The Dying Earth Genre and the Solar Trajectory**

The setting of Zothique is the foundational element that dictates the story's mood, themes, and metaphysical possibilities. As established in the literary tradition of Clark Ashton Smith, Zothique is the "last continent of earth," existing in a far-future timeline where "the sun no longer shone with the whiteness of its prime, but was dim and tarnished as if with a vapor of blood".2 "The Garden of Final Moments" faithfully reconstructs this cosmology, opening with the image of the sun as a "pustulent clot" and an "ancient ruby bled of its primordial fire".1

This solar imagery is not merely atmospheric; it is ontological. The "bleeding" of the sun suggests a universe that is physically wounded, leaking its vital essence into the void. In the context of **Genre Conventions (Topic 9\)**, this places the text firmly within the "Dying Earth" subgenre, characterized by a sense of "world-weariness," "entropy," and the "exhaustion of resources".4 Unlike the post-apocalyptic genre, which often focuses on survival and rebuilding after a catastrophe, the Dying Earth genre focuses on the *inevitability* of the end.5 There is no rebuilding in Zothique; there is only the "unending vista of decay".1

The solar exhaustion mirrors the "pan-psychic fatigue" of the inhabitants. The text notes that "even the shadows themselves seemed wearied unto extinction".1 This personification of the shadows (Topic 8: Style and Language) serves to animate the inorganic world, a key trope of the Weird, while simultaneously draining the animate world of its vitality. The boundaries between the living and the dead, the active and the passive, are blurring under the red light of a dying star.

### **2\. Cimpala and the Urban Gothic**

The protagonist, Calantha, begins her journey in Cimpala, described as the "ultimate metropolis" of this moribund world.1 The use of the word "ultimate" here is double-edged, signifying both "greatest" and "last." Cimpala is the terminal point of urban civilization. The architectural details—"spires," "cyclopean flagstones," "vermilion ruins"—evoke a sense of history that is so heavy it has crushed the present.1

In terms of **Historical/Cultural Context (Topic 11\)**, the depiction of Cimpala reflects the anxieties of the interwar period in which Smith originally wrote (and which this story emulates), where the collapse of empires and the decay of established orders were palpable fears.2 The city is a place of "bureaucratic finality," as seen in the city guard's dismissive reaction to Phanes's death.1 This bureaucracy of death highlights the banality of mortality in a world where "monstrous gods" and "fallen empires" are commonplace history.

The "spice market" scene introduces the **Sensory Atmosphere (Topic 32\)** that pervades the text. The "funereal perfumes of cinnamon and myrrh" connect the commercial life of the city directly to the rituals of death.1 In Zothique, even the act of trade is scented with the grave. This aligns with the "Decadent" literary movement's obsession with exotic scents and the aestheticization of decay, creating a "miasma" that the reader can almost smell.7

### **3\. Deep Time and Geological Weird**

The journey from Cimpala to the Mountains of the Dead introduces the theme of **Temporal Distortion (Topic 23\)** and **Deep Time**. Calantha walks upon "flagstones fractured and swallowed by seas of ochre sand".1 The landscape is a palimpsest of forgotten eras. The "bleached bones of monstrous, ancient beasts" serve as milestones, reminding the protagonist (and the reader) of the **Cosmic Insignificance (Topic 16\)** of humanity.1

In Weird Fiction, geology often acts as a hostile witness to human brevity. The "Mountains of the Dead" are not just a location; they are a geological assertion of mortality. The reference to "cyclopean" architecture links the text to the Lovecraftian tradition, where "cyclopean" denotes a scale that is non-human and indifferent to human proportions.2 The environment itself is an agent of "scouring," stripping away Calantha's "soft, aching grief" until only a "desperate resolve" remains.1 This suggests that the landscape of Zothique actively shapes the psychology of its inhabitants, turning them into reflections of its own harsh, mineral reality.

**III. The Weaver's Dilemma: Characterisation and Narrative Structure**

### **1\. Calantha: The Archivist of Oblivion**

Calantha is introduced as a "weaver of funerary tapestries".1 This profession is rich with **Symbolism (Topic 6\)**. Weaving is archetypally linked to the Fates (Moirai) who spin the thread of life, but Calantha's weaving is strictly retrospective.8 She attempts to "ensnare the last coruscations of legends," acting as an archivist who seeks to preserve the ephemeral.1

Her character arc represents a shift from *representation* to *participation*. Initially, she believes that art (the tapestry) can capture the reality of death. However, upon seeing Phanes, she realizes that "no thread... could capture the horror".1 This is the **Ineffability (Topic 17\)** of the Weird: the realization that traditional artistic mediums (language, weaving) are insufficient to contain the "unnameable" reality of the weird event.

Calantha is a **Round Character (Topic 4\)** who undergoes a profound psychological transformation. She begins as a "melancholy" artisan and ends as a "terrible" curator. This transformation is driven by an "obsessive" need for understanding, a trope common in weird fiction where the protagonist's curiosity leads to their ontological undoing.9 Her "desperate resolve" to find Lord Pharumm is not a heroic quest for justice, but a "madness" that "grief alone could not sustain".1 She becomes a "maggot crawling with singular purpose," a self-abjecting image that highlights her descent into the non-human.1

### **2\. Phanes: The Orphic Artist and the Black Sun**

The name "Phanes" is a significant intertextual reference. In **Greek Mythology (Topic 10\)**, Phanes is the primeval deity of light and procreation, hatched from the cosmic egg.10 He is the "First-Born" who brings light to the chaos.

In "The Garden of Final Moments," this symbolism is inverted. Phanes is a sculptor (a creator), but he births a "black lily of absolute blackness".1 He is not the god of light, but the god of the "Black Sun" (a symbol of melancholy and alchemical putrefaction). His "creative ecstasy" is a "fever consuming him from within".1 He represents the **Artist Protagonist (Topic 4\)** pushed to the extreme of the **Decadent** ideal: the artist who sacrifices his life for the sake of the Masterpiece.12

Phanes's state—frozen in a moment of "rapturous revelation"—challenges the binary between life and death. He is "not dead. He was eternal".1 This paradox is central to the story's **Theme (Topic 1\)**: that the highest form of existence in a dying world is the static perfection of the art-object.

### **3\. Lord Pharumm: The Curator of the Weird**

Lord Pharumm is the "Curator," a figure of "impossible antiquity".1 He embodies the archetype of the **Decadent Collector**.14 Unlike a traditional villain who seeks power or wealth, Pharumm seeks "aesthetic" satisfaction. He views Phanes's death not as a tragedy but as a "flawless acquisition".1

Pharumm operates with a "detached, appreciative glint," representing the **Scientific/Clinical Gaze** applied to the supernatural. He is a master of **Weird Materialism (Topic 29\)**, manipulating the boundaries between the organic and the inorganic. His relationship with Calantha is transactional but also mentorship-based; he teaches her to view the world through his "dead" eyes. He is the Demiurge of the Garden, maintaining its "ordered morbidity" against the entropy of the outside world.

### **4\. Narrative Structure: The Katabasis and the Anti-Catharsis**

The **Narrative Structure (Topic 2\)** follows a linear trajectory of descent (*katabasis*).

1. **Departure:** Calantha leaves the "relative shelter" of Cimpala.  
2. **Liminal Crossing:** The journey through the desert and the "Mountains of the Dead."  
3. **Initiation:** The month of servitude in the Garden.  
4. **Revelation:** The viewing of the Masterpiece (Phanes).  
5. **Return/Transformation:** Calantha leaves, but she is fundamentally altered.

Crucially, the story refuses **Closure (Topic 33\)**. There is no rescue, no resurrection, and no restoration of the natural order. Calantha does not destroy the "abomination" of Phanes's statue; she accepts it as "beautiful." The ending is an **Anti-Catharsis**: the tension is not released but *crystallized*. The reader is left with the image of Calantha holding the "black seed," promising a future where the horror will be cultivated and propagated.1 This refusal of reassurance is a defining characteristic of Weird Fiction, leaving the reader in a state of "ontological destabilization".15

**IV. The Garden as Heterotopia: Atmosphere and Weird Ecology**

### **1\. The Garden of Adompha: Intertextual Roots**

The "hidden garden" is a direct homage to Clark Ashton Smith's "The Garden of Adompha".16 In Smith's original story, King Adompha and the wizard Dwerulas graft human body parts onto plants for sadistic pleasure. "The Garden of Final Moments" elevates this concept from mere sadism to **High Aestheticism**.

While Adompha's garden was a place of "obscene" graftings, Pharumm's garden is a place of "ordered morbidity".1 The horror is the same—**Body Horror (Topic 20\)** and **Hybridity (Topic 24\)**—but the *framing* has shifted. Pharumm’s garden is a museum. The "King Who Wept Jewels" and "The Lovers of Tsur" are exhibits. This intertextuality enriches the story for fans of the genre, positioning it as a sophisticated commentary on Smith’s original themes of "decadence" and "cruelty".2

### **2\. Weird Nature and Non-Human Agency**

The ecology of the garden is a prime example of **Weird Nature (Topic 21\)**. The trees are "petrified," yet they form a "canopy." The path is made of "crushed vertebrae".1 This environment blurs the line between the *grown* and the *built*. In the Weird, nature is often hostile or "wrong".18 Here, nature has been entirely subsumed by the necromantic will of Pharumm.

The "Black Lily" is the apex of this weird ecology. It is an "affront to the sun-scorched earth," possessing "petals like carved fragments of primordial night".1 It represents **Non-Human Agency**, as its roots "intertwined with the petrified veins" of Phanes. The plant is not merely growing on him; it is *becoming* him, or he is becoming it. This symbiotic parasitism disrupts the anthropocentric view of man as the master of nature. In the garden, man is merely soil for the "ultimate aesthetic."

### **3\. Atmosphere over Plot**

The story prioritizes **Atmosphere (Topic 32\)** over complex plotting. The middle section, detailing Calantha's servitude, is a series of static tableaux. We are asked to contemplate the "spectral dagger," the "cloudy gems," and the "salt-like crystals of rage".1

This focus on *mood*—specifically a mood of **Dread and Melancholy (Topic 7\)**—is typical of the "Zothique" style.2 The "cloyingly sweet miasma of asphodel and decay" permeates the text. The lighting is always "dim, ruddy," filtering through a "chalice of ancient wine." These sensory details create a hypnotic effect, lulling the reader into the same trance-like state as the protagonist. The "pacing" slows down to match the "geological time" of the petrified garden.

## ---

**V. The Ontology of the Statue: Weird Materialism and OOO**

### **1\. Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO) and the "Thing-in-Itself"**

The philosophical core of the story can be analyzed through **Object-Oriented Ontology (Topic 29\)**. OOO posits that objects have a reality independent of human perception and that they withdraw from us, never fully revealing their essence.19

In the story, the "statues" (which are actually transformed people) become **Weird Objects**. The "King Who Wept Jewels" transforms his internal subjectivity (avarice) into external objects (gems). This is a literalization of **Weird Materialism**—the idea that thoughts and emotions can have physical mass and weight.21 Calantha’s task to "grind" the jewels emphasizes their resistance; the dust "felt like failure itself clinging to her skin".1 The object *acts* upon her, exerting its own agency.

### **2\. The Becoming-Statue**

The climax involving Phanes is a representation of **Deleuzian Becoming (Topic 29\)**—specifically, the "becoming-statue".22 Phanes does not *die*; he enters a state of "becoming-imperceptible" or "becoming-eternal."

The text states: "He was not dead. He was eternal".1 The "black lily" acts as the catalyst for this ontological shift. By fusing with the stone and the plant, Phanes exits the biological cycle of decay and enters the geological cycle of permanence. In a world where everything is dying (entropy), the only way to survive is to become *thing*. This "becoming-object" is presented not as a loss of humanity, but as an ascension to a higher state of being—a "masterwork".1

### **3\. The Sublime vs. The Grotesque**

The story navigates the tension between the **Sublime (Topic 15\)** and the **Grotesque**.

* **The Grotesque:** The "heads of eunuchs" in Smith’s original "Garden of Adompha" are grotesque—mutilated, absurd, biological horrors.16 In this story, the "King Who Wept Jewels" leans towards the grotesque; his greed makes him monstrous.  
* The Sublime: Phanes is the Sublime. His expression is one of "rapturous revelation." He confronts the "incomprehensible" (the ultimate abyss) and is transfigured by it.  
  Burke defined the sublime as productive of "awe and terror." Calantha feels exactly this: "horror and awe competing for dominance".1 The "perfect black lily" anchors this sublime experience, giving it a form that can be viewed, if not fully understood.

### **Table 1: Typology of Transmutations in the Garden**

| Subject | Emotion/Trait | Material Manifestation | Aesthetic Category | Philosophical Implication |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **The King** | Avarice (Greed) | Cloudy Jewels | Grotesque / Abject | Materialization of Sin; The self expelled as waste. |
| **The Lovers of Tsur** | Possessive Love | Obsidian Pillar | Tragic / Monolithic | Loss of Individuation; Fusion of subjects into object. |
| **The Last Warrior** | Rage / Defiance | Salt-like Crystals | Monumental | Emotion as geological sediment; Will made manifest. |
| **Phanes** | Creative Ecstasy | Basalt & Black Lily | Sublime / Divine | The Artist becoming the Art; Transcendence of death. |
| **Calantha** | Grief | Polishing Oil | Functional / Fluid | Commodification of Affect; The subject serving the object. |

## ---

**VI. Symbolism, Intertextuality, and Decadence**

### **1\. The Black Lily and the Decadent Tradition**

The **Black Lily (Topic 6\)** is the story's central motif. In the **Decadent** literary tradition (Huysmans, Wilde, Lorrain), the "unnatural flower" (green carnation, black lily) symbolizes the rejection of Nature and the embrace of Artifice.23

* **Huysmans:** In *À rebours*, Des Esseintes collects poisonous and artificial-looking plants to satisfy his ennui.  
* The Story: Pharumm cultivates the Black Lily to satisfy his need for the "ultimate aesthetic." The lily is "impossibly perfect," its petals like "carved fragments of primordial night".1  
  This flower is an "anti-nature" symbol. It blooms from a dead/petrified body. It represents Taboo Knowledge (Topic 22)—the knowledge that death can be beautiful. The "seed" Calantha takes is a seed of this decadent philosophy; she will plant it to grow her own artificial paradise.

### **2\. Weaving vs. Sculpting**

The dichotomy between **Weaving** and **Sculpting** structures the narrative's metaphysical argument.26

* **Weaving (Text/Representation):** Calantha starts as a weaver. Weaving is fluid, soft, and representational. It "ensnares" legends but does not *be* them. It is associated with memory and the past.  
* Sculpting (Stone/Presence): Phanes is a sculptor. Sculpting is hard, permanent, and present. The statue is the reality.  
  The story argues that in Zothique, weaving is no longer sufficient. The "threads" cannot hold the horror. Only the "stone" can contain the "ecstatic energy." Calantha’s abandonment of the loom for the garden signifies the victory of Sculpture/Ontology over Weaving/Epistemology. She stops telling stories about death and starts making death.

### **3\. Tsur and Intertextual Geography**

The reference to the "Lovers of Tsur" 1 connects the text to the broader Cthulhu/Smith Mythos. "Tsur-lhn" is a leader of the Deep One hybrids in some mythos stories.27 "Tsur" is also Hebrew for "Rock" or "Strength" 28, adding a layer of linguistic petrification to the name. The "Lovers of Tsur" becoming a "pillar of obsidian" reinforces this etymological connection to rock and stability.

## ---

**VII. Abjection, Body Horror, and the Affective Turn**

### **1\. Kristevan Abjection**

The transformations in the garden evoke Julia Kristeva’s concept of the **Abject (Topic 20\)**—that which "disturbs identity, system, order".30 The "abject" is usually associated with bodily fluids, decay, and the corpse.

* The "King Who Wept Jewels" is abject because he blurs the boundary between *subject* (human) and *object* (jewel). He expels matter that should be internal.  
* Phanes, however, transcends abjection. While the idea of a flower growing from a chest is visceral body horror, the text frames it as "perfect." The "black lily" is not a tumor; it is a "focal point".1  
  The story moves from the Abject (the gross graftings of Adompha) to the Aesthetic (the clean lines of Pharumm). It sanitizes the horror, which is, in itself, a more disturbing form of horror.

### **2\. Affective Goals: Dread and Awe**

The story aims to produce **Dread and Awe (Topic 25\)** rather than "jump scare" horror.

* **Dread:** Generated by the slow pacing, the atmosphere of decay, and the inevitability of the ending. The reader knows Calantha is being seduced by the garden, but cannot stop it.  
* Awe: Generated by the description of Phanes. The language shifts to the register of the holy ("blasphemy of perfect grace," "divine visitation").1  
  This mixture constitutes the "Weird Affect"—a feeling of being in the presence of something that is "Wholly Other" (Otto’s mysterium tremendum).

## ---

**VIII. Philosophical Underpinnings: Nihilism, Cosmicism, and Epistemology**

### **1\. Cosmicism and the Annihilation of Anthropocentrism**

The story is deeply rooted in Cosmicism (Topic 16).32 The universe of Zothique is vast, old, and indifferent. The sun is dying, and humanity is merely a "maggot" on the corpse of the world.1  
This perspective leads to the Annihilation of Anthropocentrism. Human emotions (grief, love) are shown to be small and temporary compared to the "geological time" of the mountains and the "cosmic time" of the dying sun. Calantha’s journey is a process of learning to see herself from this cosmic perspective—to see herself as material, as a "maggot," and finally, as a cultivator of the eternal.

### **2\. Epistemological Rupture and Forbidden Knowledge**

Calantha seeks to "understand" Phanes's death. This drive for knowledge leads to an **Epistemological Rupture (Topic 18\)**.

* *Rational Knowledge:* The city guard explains the death as "divine visitation" (a dismissal).  
* *Forbidden Knowledge:* The merchant in the spice market whispers of "Lord Pharumm" (the occult truth).  
* Revelation: In the garden, Calantha learns that "death is the ultimate aesthetic."  
  This knowledge breaks her. She can no longer function in the normal world of Cimpala. She has seen the "verity most chilling" 1 and accepted it. The rupture is permanent.

### **3\. Anti-Catharsis and the Refusal of Closure**

The story’s ending is a deliberate **Anti-Catharsis (Topic 33\)**.

* *Expectation:* Calantha will save Phanes or destroy the evil wizard.  
* Reality: Calantha agrees with the wizard. "It is beautiful," she whispers.1  
  She leaves with the seed, implying she will replicate the horror. This refusal to restore moral order is central to the Weird. The "Weird" does not offer comfort; it offers "ontological destabilization." The reader is left with the unsettling realization that the protagonist has defected to the side of the monsters (or rather, the side of the objects).

## ---

**IX. Ideological and Cultural Critique**

### **1\. The Commodification of the Body**

Through an **Ideological Critique (Topic 13\)**, the story can be read as a commentary on the **Commodification of the Artist**. Phanes is literally turned into a *thing* to be collected. His "creative ecstasy" is harvested by Lord Pharumm.

* Pharumm represents the "Patron" or the "Market" that consumes the artist.  
* The "King Who Wept Jewels" represents the capitalist accumulation of wealth turning the subject into a producer of commodities (jewels), even in death.  
* Calantha’s grief is commodified into "polishing oil."  
  The garden is a factory of aesthetics where human subjectivity is extracted and refined into art-objects.

### **2\. Gender and the Male Gaze**

The "Male Gaze" is present in Pharumm’s collection. He collects "moments." However, Calantha subverts this by becoming the *viewer*. She takes on the "Curator's Gaze." She looks at Phanes (the male body) and objectifies him.

* "She could not stop her eyes from tracing the lines of his form... the tautness of the muscle... the sublime curve of his neck".1  
  Here, the female protagonist objectifies the male body, turning the tables on the traditional "Garden of Adompha" trope where women’s breasts and hair were grafted onto plants.16 In Pharumm’s garden, the male body (Phanes, the King, the Warrior) is the site of transformation and objectification.

## ---

**X. Conclusion: The Seed of the Weird**

"The Garden of Final Moments" is a quintessential text of the Neo-Decadent Weird. It successfully resurrects the dying sun of Zothique to illuminate the modern anxieties of artistic production and ontological stability.

Through the character of Calantha, the story explores the **Transgression (Topic 31\)** of the ultimate taboo: the aestheticization of death. By refusing to look away—by choosing to *stare* into the "ultimate abyss"—Calantha moves beyond the human. She accepts the "black seed" of the Weird.

The analysis reveals that the story functions as a machine for **Ontological Uncertainty (Topic 19\)**. It breaks down the barriers between:

1. **Life and Death** (Phanes is "eternal").  
2. **Subject and Object** (The King becomes jewels).  
3. **Nature and Artifice** (The Black Lily).  
4. **Grief and Aesthetics** (Tears become oil).

In the final assessment, the story argues that in a world devoid of hope (Zothique), the only meaningful act is the creation of the **Sublime Object**. If the world is a corpse, one must become the "maggot" that weaves the rot into a tapestry, or the gardener who turns the decay into a "black lily." It is a dark, nihilistic, yet strangely triumphant affirmation of the power of Art to endure "beyond the dying of suns."
