# The Heresy of Ubloth-Vha

**Summary**

H.P. Lovecraft's "Herbert West—Reanimator" is reimagined in the dying-earth world of Clark Ashton Smith's Zothique.

In the city of Ustaim, where necromancy is a hollow ritual, the scholar Ptemen is seduced by the forbidden science of Ubloth-Vha, a heretic who claims life can be chemically reignited. As his lone disciple, Ptemen assists in ghastly experiments within a desecrated tomb. Their attempts to conquer death, however, only unleash mindless, rampaging horrors upon the world.

Their greatest hubris—reanimating their nemesis, the sorcerer Lord Ossaru—creates a cunning monster that terrorizes the city. Forced to flee, their work grows more depraved. Ptemen’s role corrodes from assistant to accomplice when a shocking experiment reveals his master is no longer just reviving the dead, but creating them. As Ubloth-Vha descends into a macabre artistry of twitching flesh and blasphemous chimeras, a silent legion of their past failures returns, an army of the undead led by a figure from their past who has come to exact a terrible revenge.

It is my curse to remember Ustaim, that city of sepulchres whose towers of fulvous stone climb toward a sun grown weary and red. We who dwelt there were but fleeting tenants in a metropolis owned by the numberless dead, for beneath its marbled avenues lay a necropolis so vast as to rival the vaults of hell. In the academies, I, Ptemen, found only a tedious balm for a dying world. The droning lectures on the summoning of geists and the proper appeasement of underworldly satraps were to me but so much charlatanry, a gaudy theatre of incense and superstition.

My fate was sealed on that evening when I first beheld Ubloth-Vha. The esteemed Lord Ossaru was holding forth on the soul’s somnolent pilgrimage through the nine shadowy spheres when a figure arose from the shadowed pews. He was a man gaunt and fleshless, an exile, it was whispered, from the sun-scoured ruins of Cincor. His voice was like the chipping of obsidian, and with it, he flayed the revered master’s tedious doctrines. He called the soul a poet’s fancy, and death a mere cessation of internal humours. Life, he avowed, was a sanguine fire, a chemistry of the flesh that could, with the proper catalyst, be coaxed to burn again. A miasma of scandal filled the hall, but for me, his words were a revelation.

I sought him later, in a squalid tavern where the air was thick with the reek of sour wine and ageless dust. There, in the guttering lamplight, he unveiled his philosophy entire. His pale eyes held a terrifying fire that seemed to penetrate the veil of skin and sinew, to perceive the intricate clockwork of the mortal machine. He offered me no empty rituals, but a tangible, empirical truth: the power to wrest from oblivion its clammy prize and command life itself. Seduced by this appalling vision, I pledged my service, and so became the first and only disciple to the heretic of Cincor.

Lord Ossaru, his dignity savaged, moved swiftly to excommunicate my new master from all scholarly circles, branding his work a blasphemy against the immutable order of creation. This proscription served only to temper Ubloth-Vha’s resolve to a terrible keenness. He led me through the city’s forgotten underworks, down into the foetid dark of a tomb sealed since some primordial dynasty. There, amidst leering sarcophagi and the crushing weight of dead centuries, we established our laboratory. The gleam of alchemical glassware was a strange and modern intrusion upon crumbling hieroglyphs; the sharp perfume of exotic reagents warred with the dry, sterile odour of ancient dust.

Our first subject was a thing of horror dragged from the pauper-pits beneath a sliver of leprous moon—a hulking desert warrior, his sedition silenced by the executioner's blade, his vast musculature already cooling toward the rigor of the grave. Upon a slab of porphyry, Ubloth-Vha worked with the unnerving precision of a master jeweller, his hands as steady as the stone itself as he filled a crystalline syringe with a shimmering, ichor-like fluid of his own devising.

“Observe, Ptemen,” he murmured, and his voice was a dead thing in that chamber of the dead. “Not a plea, but a command.”

He drove the needle into the warrior’s carotid. We watched. For an eternity, nothing. Then, a faint, unwholesome flush suffused the corpse’s skin; a tremor, violent and brief, agitated its limbs. Then, again, nothing. The silence that followed was heavy with failure. As Ubloth-Vha turned to his charts, muttering of miscalculations, a shriek tore through the tomb. It was a sound not of this earth; a vocalization bereft of pain or fear, but of pure, explosive, and unnatural energy that seemed to violate the very stones around us. We fled, our lamp casting a hysteria of shadows as we scrambled through the labyrinthine dark. Days later, whispers slithered through the city: of a mysterious fire and collapse in the lower catacombs, and of the warrior’s niche, smashed open from within, its granite scored by frantic gouges, as if some beast of impossible strength had clawed its way toward the world of the living. A dread as cold as the tomb itself began to coil in my gut.

Then came the Crimson Sweat, a pestilence that fell upon Ustaim like a bloody shroud, and the city became a charnel house. The pyres burned day and night, their greasy smoke mingling with the lamentations of the dying. To Ubloth-Vha, this apocalypse was a ghastly carnival of opportunity, an endless, shuffling parade of fresh specimens. He toiled with a maniacal fervour, and the failures—the things that jerked and stilled, or merely rotted with a preternatural swiftness—were piled in a desecrated corner of our tomb.

In the world above, Lord Ossaru became the city's saviour. His potent necromancies held the plague at bay within the noble quarters, and his name was invoked as a benediction by the terrified masses. But even his formidable sorceries could not grant him immortality. He, too, at last succumbed, and the city that had hailed him as a hero now mourned him as a god.

For Ubloth-Vha, this was the moment of ultimate vindication. On the night of Ossaru’s entombment, we crept like sacrilegious vermin into the grand mausoleum. The theft was a tense, unholy affair, our furtive sounds echoing in the hallowed silence. Back in the laboratory, Ubloth-Vha gloated over the corpse of his nemesis, his face a mask of triumphant malice. “He who called me blasphemer will now serve as testament to my truth,” he hissed, and plunged the needle home.

The reanimation was immediate, and it was utter horror. Lord Ossaru’s body lurched into a ghastly semblance of life, but the eyes that had once held such brilliance were vacant, the windows to a shattered mind. This was no man restored, but a puppet of flesh animated by a feral and malevolent cunning. Before we could lay hands on it, the creature smashed its way from the tomb. For one night, it rampaged through the moon-silvered streets of Ustaim—a familiar, honoured face twisted into a mask of bestial rage, its passage marked by a trail of broken bodies and a contagion of terror. The city guard, after a bloody melee in which the thing displayed a strength that was not of mortal muscle, cornered it in the market square. It was captured and consigned to the deepest oubliette, its identity a shame-kept secret of the city’s rulers. It passed into whispered legend: the Nameless Horror of Ustaim.

We fled Ustaim, a curse upon our heels. For years we were wraiths, drifting through the dying world until we found a dubious refuge in the oasis of Ilderath, a speck of feverish green huddled against the infinite, sun-blasted alkali flats. Here we posed as humble physicians, our past a dark and festering secret. I found a fragile peace in the stark, clean silence of the desert, but the isolation only served to concentrate Ubloth-Vha’s obsession, distilling it to a black and potent poison.

His morbid curiosity was rekindled when a caravan brought with it the corpse of a ghoul—one of the hunched, leathery things of the wastes—slain in some misbegotten skirmish. He was feverishly eager to test his refined elixir on non-human tissue. He procured the body, marvelling at its strange, sinewy anatomy, so unlike the architecture of man. The experiment, however, was another seeming failure. The ghoul’s carrion-flesh remained inert. Disgusted, we dragged the carcass into the dunes beyond the city walls and gave it a shallow grave.

But the alien biology of the creature, coupled with the furnace-heat of the desert, had only delayed the elixir's grim work. That night, I was awoken by screams from the poorer quarter. The reanimated ghoul, endowed with a speed and savagery far exceeding its natural kin, had clawed its way free. It had torn its way into the hovel of a sleeping family, and the wet, tearing sounds of its cannibalistic frenzy were a language I had become horribly fluent in. Aroused from his charts, a furious Ubloth-Vha confronted his creation in the moon-drenched street. It was a desperate, whirling battle. The creature was unnaturally resilient, but Ubloth-Vha, employing a specially-prepared poison dart fired from a blowgun, at last brought the monster down. He stood over the twitching corpse, his face illuminated by the cold moonlight, and I saw in his eyes not remorse, but a cold, analytical fury. The unpredictability of his results was a flaw in his science, an impurity that he must, at any cost, eradicate.

The ghoul’s rampage had solidified a new and dreadful conviction in my master. To reanimate the body, he now reasoned, was a mere parlour trick. The true conquest was to rekindle the mind, to restore the ghost to its machine. He became consumed by this new ambition, refining his elixir with tinctures of rare black lotuses and mineral salts rumoured to affect the very seat of consciousness. For months he toiled, until at last he held a vial of clear, silver liquid that he deemed perfect.

His chance arrived with a caravan from Yoros. In the clamour of the bazaar, a wealthy merchant, a man famed for his robust health and booming laugh, collapsed, writhing in what all took to be a fatal seizure. No one questioned the quiet, unassuming physician, Ubloth-Vha, when he discreetly arranged to have the body moved to his workshop, ostensibly to prepare it for its final journey.

In the lamplit silence of our laboratory, I watched, my heart a frantic drum against my ribs, pounding with a hideous amalgam of terror and hope. This, I thought, could be the moment that redeemed all our foul deeds. Ubloth-Vha injected the silver fluid. The result was breathtaking. The merchant sat bolt upright, not with the mindless rage of our past failures, but with a lucid and fearful intelligence dawning in his eyes. He looked about him, first with confusion, then with a dawning horror.

Trembling, I leaned close. "You have returned," I whispered in awe. "Tell us... what did you see on the other side?"

The merchant's eyes, wide with a terror not of the tomb but of a memory only seconds old, locked onto Ubloth-Vha. His face, a moment ago a mask of returning reason, contorted into a rictus of pure, undiluted agony and betrayal. He screamed, his voice a raw shriek that clawed at the soul.

"Sorcerer\! Murderer\! Keep away from me\! That needle—by the gods, that cursed needle\!"

He gave one final, agonized shudder and collapsed, his life not restored, but extinguished for good. A silence as deep as the grave descended. I stared, the man’s last words echoing in the ruins of my spirit. He had not died of a seizure. The seizure was the murder. Ubloth-Vha had not found a specimen; he had made one. And in that moment of ghastly revelation, I knew that I was no longer the assistant to a scientist, but the accomplice to a monster.

That scream was the death knell of what little soul Ubloth-Vha had ever possessed. He abandoned all pretense of science and descended into a ghoulish artistry of the macabre. His workshop became a gallery of abominations: twitching, severed hands nourished by noisome fluids in jars of green glass; blasphemous chimeras of man and beast stitched together in a parody of creation. A palpable doom settled over our lives, a stench of corruption that clung to our very clothes.

The end arrived on a night when the desert wind howled with the grief of a thousand chained spirits. A procession entered Ilderath, silent and purposeful, moving through the deserted streets like a tide of black water. It was led by a stately figure in a dark, tattered robe, its face a flawless, immobile mask of gleaming gold. Behind it shuffled a grotesque legion, an army of resurrected nightmares. In their shambling forms, I recognized the hulking shape of the desert warrior, the hunched and predatory silhouette of the cannibal ghoul, and dozens of other misshapen things, the half-forgotten failures from our years of labour.

The golden-masked figure halted before our door. When it spoke, the voice was a hollow, ventriloquial whisper that seemed to emanate from all around us, a voice that struck me with a jolt of absolute, soul-freezing terror. It was the voice of Lord Ossaru. His brilliant, vengeful mind, somehow preserved and enthroned within that animated corpse, had gathered his fellow victims. He had come for his revenge.

Ubloth-Vha stood frozen, his arrogance and intellect finally shattered by the sight of his past sins given form and purpose. He did not fight. He did not scream. He only stared as the Nameless Horror—his first great failure—seized him in its inhuman grip. Then the entire legion swarmed him. In a silent, gruesome whirlwind of tearing flesh and snapping bone, they dismembered their creator.

Lord Ossaru, the thing in the golden mask, calmly stooped and retrieved Ubloth-Vha's severed head from the blood-spattered floor. As the legion turned and shambled back into the blackness of the endless desert, they carried with them the grisly fragments of the man who had given them their wretched half-life. I was left alone in the charnel house of our workshop, my sanity irrevocably broken, the sole, silent witness to a horror the dying world of Zothique could never possibly comprehend.

The End.
