# The Heresy of Ubloth-Vha

**Summary**

H.P. Lovecraft's "Herbert West-Reanimator" is reimagined in the dying-earth world of Clark Ashton Smith's Zothique.

In the city of Ustaim, where necromancy has calcified into hollow ritual, the scholar Ptemen becomes enthralled by the forbidden science of Ubloth-Vha, a heretic who proclaims that life can be chemically rekindled. As his sole disciple, Ptemen assists in ghastly experiments within a desecrated tomb. Their attempts to vanquish death, however, only unleash mindless, rampaging horrors upon an indifferent world.

Their supreme hubris: the reanimation of their nemesis, the sorcerer Lord Ossaru. This creates a cunning monster that terrorizes the city with fell intelligence. Forced to flee, their work grows ever more depraved. Ptemen's role corrodes from assistant to accomplice when a shocking experiment reveals his master is no longer merely reviving the dead, but creating them. As Ubloth-Vha descends into a macabre artistry of twitching flesh and blasphemous chimeras, a silent legion of their past failures returns, an army of the undead led by a figure from their past who has come to exact a terrible and inexorable revenge.

---

It is my curse to remember Ustaim, that city of sepulchres whose towers of fulvous stone climb toward a sun grown weary and incarnadine. We who dwelt there were but fleeting tenants in a metropolis owned by the numberless dead, for beneath its marbled avenues lay a necropolis so vast and labyrinthine as to rival the vaults of hell itself. In the academies, I, Ptemen, found only a tedious balm for a dying world, a soporific draught for the soul's last agonies. The droning lectures on the summoning of geists and the proper appeasement of underworldly satraps were to me but so much charlatanry: a gaudy theatre of incense and superstition, empty as the husks of long-desiccated beetles.

My fate was sealed irrevocably on that evening when I first beheld Ubloth-Vha. The esteemed Lord Ossaru was holding forth on the soul's somnolent pilgrimage through the nine shadowy spheres when a figure arose from the shadowed pews like a specter conjured from the académie's own musty darkness. He was a man gaunt and fleshless, an exile (it was whispered with mingled dread and fascination) from the sun-scoured ruins of Cincor. His voice was like the chipping of obsidian, cold and sharp, and with it he flayed the revered master's tedious doctrines with surgical precision. He called the soul a poet's fancy, a comforting delusion, and death a mere cessation of internal humours. Life, he avowed in tones that brooked no contradiction, was a sanguine fire: a chemistry of the flesh that could, with the proper catalyst and understanding, be coaxed to burn again. A miasma of scandal filled the vaulted hall, thick as tomb-vapors, but for me his words were a revelation, a key turning in the rusted lock of my complacency.

I sought him later, in a squalid tavern where the air hung thick and cloying with the reek of sour wine and ageless dust. There, in the guttering lamplight that cast his hollow features into a landscape of shadow and bone, he unveiled his philosophy entire. His pale eyes held a terrifying fire that seemed to penetrate the veil of skin and sinew, to perceive the intricate clockwork of the mortal machine in all its delicate complexity. He offered me no empty rituals, no invocations to deaf and distant gods, but a tangible, empirical truth: the power to wrest from oblivion its clammy prize and command life itself. Seduced utterly by this appalling vision, intoxicated by the prospect of such forbidden knowledge, I pledged my service without reservation, and so became the first and only disciple to the heretic of Cincor.

Lord Ossaru, his dignity savaged and his authority undermined, moved swiftly to excommunicate my new master from all scholarly circles, branding his work a blasphemy against the immutable order of creation. This proscription served only to temper Ubloth-Vha's resolve to a terrible keenness, to whet his ambition upon the stone of opposition. He led me through the city's forgotten underworks, down through strata of accumulated centuries, into the foetid dark of a tomb sealed since some primordial dynasty. There, amidst leering sarcophagi and the crushing weight of dead centuries, we established our laboratory. The gleam of alchemical glassware was a strange and modern intrusion upon crumbling hieroglyphs; the sharp, acrid perfume of exotic reagents warred perpetually with the dry, sterile odour of ancient dust and older death.

Our first subject was a thing of horror dragged from the pauper-pits beneath a sliver of leprous moon: a hulking desert warrior, his sedition silenced forever by the executioner's blade, his vast musculature already cooling toward the rigor of the grave. Upon a slab of porphyry worn smooth by unimaginable age, Ubloth-Vha worked with the unnerving precision of a master jeweller, his hands as steady as the stone itself as he filled a crystalline syringe with a shimmering, ichor-like fluid of his own devising, the product of months of arcane research.

"Observe closely, Ptemen," he murmured, and his voice was a dead thing in that chamber of the dead, flat and toneless. "Not a plea, but a command."

He drove the needle deep into the warrior's carotid with practiced ease. We watched, scarcely daring to breathe. For an eternity measured in heartbeats, nothing. Then, a faint, unwholesome flush suffused the corpse's waxy skin; a tremor, violent and brief as a convulsion, agitated its massive limbs. Then, again, nothing but the oppressive silence of the tomb. The silence that followed was heavy with failure, thick as a burial shroud. As Ubloth-Vha turned to his charts with a grunt of frustration, muttering of miscalculations and impurities, a shriek tore through the tomb. It was a sound not of this earth; a vocalization bereft of pain or fear, but of pure, explosive, and unnatural energy that seemed to violate the very stones around us, to make them ring with sympathetic horror. We fled in blind panic, our lamp casting a hysteria of shadows as we scrambled through the labyrinthine dark, pursued by that inhuman sound. Days later, whispers slithered through the city like serpents: of a mysterious fire and collapse in the lower catacombs, and of the warrior's niche, smashed open from within, its granite scored by frantic gouges, as if some beast of impossible strength had clawed its way toward the world of the living. A dread as cold as jade began to coil in my gut like some parasitic thing.

Then came the Crimson Sweat, a pestilence that fell upon Ustaim like a bloody shroud, and the city became a charnel house under the pitiless sun. The pyres burned day and night, their greasy smoke mingling with the lamentations of the dying to create a miasma of despair. To Ubloth-Vha, this apocalypse was a ghastly carnival of opportunity, an endless, shuffling parade of fresh specimens delivered to our very threshold. He toiled with a maniacal fervour that bordered on religious ecstasy, and the failures (the things that jerked and stilled, or merely rotted with a preternatural swiftness that defied nature) were piled in a desecrated corner of our tomb, a charnel mound of our hubris.

In the world above, Lord Ossaru became the city's saviour, its bulwark against annihilation. His potent necromancies held the plague at bay within the noble quarters, and his name was invoked as a benediction by the terrified masses huddled behind their walls. But even his formidable sorceries, vast as they were, could not grant him immortality. He, too, at last succumbed to the Crimson Sweat, and the city that had hailed him as a hero now mourned him as a god, elevating him to their pantheon of the beloved dead.

For Ubloth-Vha, this was the moment of ultimate vindication, the convergence of opportunity and revenge. On the night of Ossaru's entombment, we crept like sacrilegious vermin into the grand mausoleum, navigating past guards and wards with the skill of seasoned grave-robbers. The theft was a tense, unholy affair, our furtive sounds echoing in the hallowed silence like profanations made audible. Back in the laboratory, Ubloth-Vha gloated over the corpse of his nemesis, his face a mask of triumphant malice that made him terrible to behold. "He who called me blasphemer will now serve as testament to my truth," he hissed through clenched teeth, and plunged the needle home with savage satisfaction.

The reanimation was immediate, and it was utter horror beyond my darkest imaginings. Lord Ossaru's body lurched into a ghastly semblance of life, but the eyes that had once held such brilliance and penetrating intelligence were vacant: the windows to a shattered mind, a consciousness broken and remade into something Other. This was no man restored, but a puppet of flesh animated by a feral and malevolent cunning that had never graced human thought. Before we could lay hands on it, the creature smashed its way from the tomb with superhuman strength. For one night, it rampaged through the moon-silvered streets of Ustaim: a familiar, honoured face twisted into a mask of bestial rage, its passage marked by a trail of broken bodies and a contagion of terror that spread faster than the plague itself. The city guard, after a bloody melee in which the thing displayed a strength that was not of mortal muscle or earthly origin, cornered it at last in the market square. It was captured and consigned to the deepest oubliette, its identity a shame-kept secret of the city's rulers, a wound to civic pride too deep to expose. It passed into whispered legend: the Nameless Horror of Ustaim, spoken of only in the darkest hours.

We fled Ustaim, a curse upon our heels and our names anathema. For years we were wraiths, drifting through the dying world like restless shades until we found a dubious refuge in the oasis of Ilderath, a speck of feverish green huddled against the infinite, sun-blasted alkali flats that stretched to every horizon. Here we posed as humble physicians, our past a dark and festering secret that we guarded with paranoid vigilance. I found a fragile peace in the stark, clean silence of the desert, but the isolation only served to concentrate Ubloth-Vha's obsession, distilling it to a black and potent poison that seeped into his every thought.

His morbid curiosity was rekindled to blazing intensity when a caravan brought with it the corpse of a ghoul: one of the hunched, leathery things of the wastes, slain in some misbegotten skirmish over carrion-rights. He was feverishly eager to test his refined elixir on non-human tissue, to see if the principles held across the boundaries of species. He procured the body through bribery and misdirection, marvelling at its strange, sinewy anatomy, so unlike the familiar architecture of man. The experiment, however, was another seeming failure, the ghoul's carrion-flesh remaining inert and cold. Disgusted, we dragged the carcass into the dunes beyond the city walls under cover of darkness and gave it a shallow grave in the shifting sand.

But the alien biology of the creature, coupled with the furnace-heat of the desert that cooked the sand to glass, had only delayed the elixir's grim work. That night, I was awoken by screams from the poorer quarter, cries of such visceral terror that they penetrated even the thick walls of our dwelling. The reanimated ghoul, endowed with a speed and savagery far exceeding its natural kin, had clawed its way free of its inadequate grave. It had torn its way into the hovel of a sleeping family, and the wet, tearing sounds of its cannibalistic frenzy were a language I had become horribly fluent in over our years of experimentation. Aroused from his charts, a furious Ubloth-Vha confronted his creation in the moon-drenched street, armed with the implements of our trade. It was a desperate, whirling battle that drew a horrified audience. The creature was unnaturally resilient, its vitality terrible to behold, but Ubloth-Vha, employing a specially-prepared poison dart fired from a blowgun, at last brought the monster down. He stood over the twitching corpse, his face illuminated by the cold moonlight, and I saw in his eyes not remorse, but a cold, analytical fury. The unpredictability of his results was a flaw in his science, an impurity that he must, at any cost, eradicate utterly.

The ghoul's rampage had solidified a new and dreadful conviction in my master's increasingly unhinged mind. To reanimate the body, he now reasoned, was a mere parlour trick, a crude manipulation of meat. The true conquest was to rekindle the mind, to restore the ghost to its machine, to achieve true resurrection rather than mere reanimation. He became consumed by this new ambition, possessed by it, refining his elixir with tinctures of rare black lotuses and mineral salts rumoured to affect the very seat of consciousness. For months he toiled in obsessive isolation, until at last he held aloft a vial of clear, silver liquid that caught the lamplight like molten moonstone, the culmination of all his research.

His chance arrived with a caravan from distant Yoros. In the clamour of the bazaar, a wealthy merchant (a man famed for his robust health and booming laugh) collapsed suddenly, writhing in what all took to be a fatal seizure. No one questioned the quiet, unassuming physician, Ubloth-Vha, when he discreetly arranged to have the body moved to his workshop, ostensibly to prepare it for its final journey back to his homeland.

In the lamplit silence of our laboratory, I watched, my heart a frantic drum against my ribs, pounding with a hideous amalgam of terror and hope that made me dizzy. This, I thought desperately, could be the moment that redeemed all our foul deeds, that justified the horrors we had wrought. Ubloth-Vha injected the silver fluid with trembling hands. The result was breathtaking. The merchant sat bolt upright, not with the mindless rage of our past failures, but with a lucid and fearful intelligence dawning in his eyes like a terrible sunrise. He looked about him, first with confusion, then with a dawning horror that transformed his features.

Trembling, I leaned close, hardly daring to hope. "You have returned," I whispered in awe, my voice breaking. "Tell us... what did you see on the other side?"

The merchant's eyes, wide with a terror not of the tomb but of a memory only seconds old, locked onto Ubloth-Vha with the intensity of absolute recognition. His face, a moment ago a mask of returning reason, contorted into a rictus of pure, undiluted agony and betrayal. He screamed, his voice a raw shriek that clawed at the soul and made the lamp flames gutter.

"Sorcerer! Murderer! Keep away from me! That needle: by the gods, that cursed needle!"

He gave one final, agonized shudder and collapsed, his life not restored, but extinguished for good, snuffed out like a candle in a storm. A silence as deep as the grave descended upon us, absolute and suffocating. I stared, the man's last words echoing in the ruins of my spirit, reverberating through my shattered soul. He had not died of a seizure. The seizure was the murder. Ubloth-Vha had not found a specimen; he had made one. And in that moment of ghastly revelation, in that instant of crystalline clarity, I knew that I was no longer the assistant to a scientist, but the accomplice to a monster, complicit in his crimes.

That scream was the death knell of what little soul Ubloth-Vha had ever possessed, the final snapping of whatever moral tether had remained. He abandoned all pretense of science and descended into a ghoulish artistry of the macabre, a celebration of corruption. His workshop became a gallery of abominations: twitching, severed hands nourished by noisome fluids in jars of green glass like captured malachite; blasphemous chimeras of man and beast stitched together in a parody of creation; things without names that should never have existed. A palpable doom settled over our lives, a stench of corruption that clung to our very clothes and permeated our flesh.

The end arrived on a night when the desert wind howled with the grief of a thousand chained spirits, keening their eternal lament. A procession entered Ilderath, silent and purposeful, moving through the deserted streets like a tide of black water, inexorable as fate. It was led by a stately figure in a dark, tattered robe, its face concealed by an immobile mask of gleaming gold that caught the moonlight. Behind it shuffled a grotesque legion, an army of resurrected nightmares given terrible purpose. In their shambling forms, I recognized with mounting horror the hulking shape of the desert warrior, the hunched and predatory silhouette of the cannibal ghoul, and dozens of other misshapen things: the half-forgotten failures from our years of labour, now united in their purpose.

The golden-masked figure halted before our door with eerie precision. When it spoke, the voice was a hollow, ventriloquial whisper that seemed to emanate from all around us, from the very stones and air itself: a voice that struck me with a jolt of absolute, soul-freezing terror. It was the voice of Lord Ossaru. His brilliant, vengeful mind, somehow preserved and enthroned within that animated corpse, had gathered his fellow victims across the years. He had come for his revenge, patient and inevitable as the turning of garnets in dark earth.

Ubloth-Vha stood frozen, his arrogance and intellect finally shattered by the sight of his past sins given form and purpose, made manifest and terrible. He did not fight. He did not scream. He only stared with the comprehension of the damned as the Nameless Horror (his first great failure, his first sin against nature) seized him in its inhuman grip. Then the entire legion swarmed him. In a silent, gruesome whirlwind of tearing flesh and snapping bone, they dismembered their creator with methodical thoroughness, taking their time, making it an art.

Lord Ossaru, the thing in the golden mask, calmly stooped and retrieved Ubloth-Vha's severed head from the blood-spattered floor, lifting it as a trophy. As the legion turned and shambled back into the blackness of the endless desert, they carried with them the grisly fragments of the man who had given them their wretched half-life, borne away as offerings to whatever hell awaited him. I was left alone in the charnel house of our workshop, my sanity irrevocably broken like shattered quartz, the sole, silent witness to a horror the dying world of Zothique could never possibly comprehend, a horror that would haunt me through whatever remained of my cursed existence.

The End.
