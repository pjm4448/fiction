# **A Morsel for the God**

**Summary**

In the shadow-haunted depths of a Hyperborean cavern, the sub-human Voormis drag a defiant human sacrifice to the altar of Tsathoggua, a toad-like god of slothful malevolence. As the air thickens with ancient dust and fresh blood, the deity stirs, its phosphorescent gaze promising a fate worse than death. Hylas, the captive, clings to fleeting memories of sunlight, but the god's black ichor consumes all. A chilling tale of cosmic horror, where defiance meets divine indifference in a ritual of eternal hunger. 

---

*The sun you loved is lost to lightless stone,*  
*A god who knows no pity or despair,*  
*Will find no meaning in your final prayer,*  
*But weighs the flesh that feeds his slumbering throne.*

The air in the chthonic adytum hung thick and foul, a charnel medley of immemorial dust and the stale, coppery tang of recent blood. It was a darkness that felt primordial and geologic, punctuated by a leprous fungi clinging to the cyclopean walls. This light was a thing of sickness, a super-prismatic aura of fulvous and verdigris that seemed to stain the silence itself with a cindery texture. Two figures, whose shaggy, fur-clad forms and loping gait marked them as the sub-human Voormis of the mountain, dragged a third between them. This last was a man, a purloined specimen of that smooth-skinned southern race who had lately encroached upon the verges of Hyperborea. His arms were pinioned, but his head was high, and a curse, impotent yet clear, fell from his lips into the sepulchral atmosphere.

They halted before the cavern's deepest recess, an alcove wherein the shadows were layered like sable velvet. There, the darkness seemed to coalesce, to bulge with a slumbering, obscene vitality. It was a formless, couchant mass of bat-like fur, from which the Voormis kept a reverent distance. They flung their offering forward upon the flagstones, and the man landed with a pained grunt, his defiant curse turning to a gasp as he beheld the sacrum of the god.

For a long interval, nothing stirred. The silence was so profound it seemed the very tinnitus of a dead cosmos. Then, with an infinite and horrifying sloth, the tenebrous bulk shifted. A head, huge and toad-shaped, emerged from the mass as if sculpted from the night itself. Two sleepy lids, eternally half-lowered, drew back to reveal vertical slits of oozing, green phosphor that fixed upon the sacrifice.

A voice, thick and glutinous as the primordial ooze yet unnervingly articulate, seeped into the cavern. "Ah," it rumbled, a sound like the shifting of basaltic strata. "Another. One hopes he is less stringy than the last. That Voormi chieftain had a sinewy intransigence that lingered unpleasantly on the palate."

The sacrifice, whose name had been Hylas, stared, his defiance melting into a purer, more elemental terror. For a flickering, insensate moment, his mind fled the gloom and he remembered the warmth of the sun on his lover’s hair, an image of golden light now rendered obscene by the phosphorescent gaze of the god.

The great, toad-like head swayed forward. It did not move with the swiftness of a predator, but with the unhurried, inexorable certainty of entropy itself. "And so garrulous," the voice continued, a note of weary critique entering its tone. "The silent terror is so much more… digestible. The shrieking adds a certain acidity."

A black, amorphous fluid, like a torrent of sooty quicksilver, poured from the god's barely-parted maw, engulfing the man’s head and torso. There was no sound of tearing flesh, no crunch of bone; only a faint, wet, sibilant hiss, as if a wineskin were being rapidly drained. The man’s limbs, which had begun to thrash with a final, galvanic desperation, went abruptly rigid and then fell limp. The black ichor seemed to absorb his vitality, to drink in his very essence, and in moments, it retracted back into the toad-like mouth.

What the god disgorged was a husk. A thing of parchment-dry skin stretched over a skeleton, its face a mask of hollow-eyed astonishment. From its mouth, agape in a silent, final protest, seeped a faint, chartreuse vapor that smelled of crushed, unseasonable blossoms and ancient decay. One of the Voormi acolytes shambled forward and, with the mundane indifference of a temple sweeper, hooked a claw into the desiccated corpse’s rags and dragged it into a shadowy side-fissure, where it landed with the dry clatter of bundled sticks.

The phosphorescent eyes of Tsathoggua were once more half-lidded, the great head sinking slowly back into the furry, formless mass. A final, sleepy murmur echoed in the fetid air.

"Tolerable," the god-thing sighed. "But one wishes my supplicants would consider the virtues of proper fattening."

Then, the divine slothfulness resumed its sempiternal reign, and the only movement in the cavern was the slow drip of water, measuring out the eons in the dark.

The End.
