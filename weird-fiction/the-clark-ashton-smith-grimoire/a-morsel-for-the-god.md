# A Morsel for the God

**Summary**

In the shadow-haunted depths of a Hyperborean cavern, the sub-human Voormis drag a defiant human sacrifice to the altar of Tsathoggua, a toad-like god of slothful malevolence. As the air thickens with ancient dust and fresh blood, the deity stirs, its phosphorescent gaze promising a fate worse than death. Hylas, the captive, clings to fleeting memories of sunlight, but the god's black ichor consumes all. A chilling tale of cosmic horror, where defiance meets divine indifference in a ritual of eternal hunger.

*The sun you loved is lost to lightless stone,*  
*A god who knows no pity or despair,*  
*Will find no meaning in your final prayer,*  
*But weighs the flesh that feeds his slumbering throne.*

The air in the chthonic adytum hung thick and foul, a charnel medley of immemorial dust and the stale, coppery tang of recent blood. It was a darkness that felt primordial and geologic, a tenebrous pall punctuated only by the leprous phosphorescence of fungi clinging to the cyclopean walls. This ghastly luminescence was a thing of profound sickness, a super-prismatic aura of fulvous and verdigris that seemed to stain the very silence itself with a cindery, corrupted texture. Two figures, whose hirsute, fur-clad forms and simian loping gait marked them as the sub-human Voormis of the mountain fastnesses, dragged a third figure between them with brutal efficiency. This last was a man, a purloined specimen of that smooth-skinned southern race who had lately, and most unwisely, encroached upon the verges of Hyperborea. His sinewy arms were pinioned cruelly behind him, but his head remained defiantly high, and a curse, impotent yet clear as clarion steel, fell from his trembling lips into the sepulchral atmosphere.

They halted before the cavern's deepest recess, an alcove wherein the shadows were layered and folded like sable velvet, each stratum darker than the last. There, in that uttermost darkness, the gloom seemed to coalesce and congeal, to bulge with a slumbering, obscene vitality that defied comprehension. It was a formless, couchant mass of bat-like fur, from which even the degraded Voormis kept a reverent and tremulous distance. They flung their offering forward upon the hoary flagstones, and the man landed with a pained grunt, his defiant curse transmuting to a strangled gasp as he beheld the sacrum of the god.

For a long and terrible interval, nothing stirred. The silence was so profound, so absolute, it seemed the very tinnitus of a dead and forgotten cosmos. Then, with an infinite and horrifying sloth, with the lethargy of geological epochs compressed into moments, the tenebrous bulk shifted. A head, huge and toad-shaped, emerged from the mass as if sculpted from the primal night itself. Two sleepy lids, eternally half-lowered in contemptuous somnolence, drew back with viscous reluctance to reveal vertical slits of oozing, green phosphor that fixed upon the sacrifice with an attention at once ravenous and indifferent.

A voice, thick and glutinous as the primordial ooze yet unnervingly articulate, seeped into the cavern like miasmal fog. "Ah," it rumbled, a sound like the shifting of basaltic strata beneath antediluvian seas. "Another morsel. One hopes he is less stringy than the last. That Voormi chieftain possessed a sinewy intransigence that lingered most unpleasantly upon the palate for thrice seven days."

The sacrifice, whose name in the bright southern lands had been Hylas, stared into those phosphorescent orbs, his defiance melting like snow before infernal fires into a purer, more elemental terror. For a flickering, insensate moment, his mind fled the suffocating gloom and he remembered the warmth of the amber sun upon his lover's hair, an image of golden radiance now rendered obscene and blasphemous by the phosphorescent gaze of the god.

The great, toad-like head swayed forward with ponderous deliberation. It did not move with the swiftness of a predator, but with the unhurried, inexorable certainty of entropy itself, of time's slow gnawing at the pillars of creation. "And so garrulous," the voice continued, a note of weary, almost fastidious critique entering its tone. "The silent terror is so much more… digestible. The shrieking invariably adds a certain acidity to the vital essences."

A black, amorphous fluid, like a cataract of sooty quicksilver or liquefied shadow, poured from the god's barely-parted maw, engulfing the man's head and torso in a tide of absolute negation. There was no sound of tearing flesh, no splintering crunch of bone; only a faint, wet, sibilant hiss, as if some cosmic wineskin were being rapidly drained of its contents. The man's limbs, which had begun to thrash with a final, galvanic desperation born of animal terror, went abruptly rigid and then fell limp as marionette strings severed. The black ichor seemed to absorb his vitality with vampiric hunger, to drink in his very essence and anima, and in moments that stretched like aeons, it retracted sinuously back into the toad-like mouth.

What the god disgorged, what it expelled with contemptuous finality, was a husk. A thing of parchment-dry skin stretched taut over a skeleton, its face frozen in a mask of hollow-eyed astonishment and incomprehension. From its mouth, agape in a silent, final protest against the dying of his light, seeped a faint, chartreuse vapor that smelled simultaneously of crushed, unseasonable blossoms and ancient, mummified decay. One of the Voormi acolytes shambled forward with bestial gait and, with the mundane indifference of a temple sweeper attending to quotidian duties, hooked a taloned claw into the desiccated corpse's tattered rags and dragged it unceremoniously into a shadowy side-fissure, where it landed with the dry clatter of bundled sticks and autumn leaves.

The phosphorescent eyes of Tsathoggua were once more half-lidded, occluded by nictitating membranes of shadow, the great head sinking slowly back into the furry, formless mass with the languor of a sated leviathan. A final, sleepy murmur echoed in the fetid air, reverberating from the cyclopean stones.

"Tolerable," the god-thing sighed with drowsy satisfaction. "But one does wish my supplicants would consider, if their limited intellects permit such forethought, the manifold virtues of proper fattening."

Then, the divine slothfulness resumed its sempiternal reign, and the only movement in the cavern was the slow, measured drip of water from unseen heights, measuring out the eons in the dark.

The End.
