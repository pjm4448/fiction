# Verse of the Charnel God

**Summary**  
In the city of Zul-Bha-Sair, where the dead are fed to the Charnel God, the poet Phantamos is a master of elegant horror. His verses, rich with beautiful savagery, enchant the city's elite. But his art takes on a terrifying reality when a mysterious admirer begins recreating his darkest poems as a series of gruesome murders.

Each victim is a "living poem," a grotesque tribute that perfectly mimics his verse. Horrified, Phantamos attempts to write of peace and innocence, but his muse is a fanatic who twists even the purest images into new atrocities. His desperate search for the killer leads him to the Obsidian Temple, the cold heart of the faith.

Cornered by his most devout admirer, Phantamos must weaponize his poetry in a desperate attempt to survive the night. But in the heart of the Charnel God's temple, some words are more powerful than prayers, and speaking them might invoke an answer he is not prepared to receive.

---

The sun, that dim, rouge-caked invalid, bled its final light across the basalt towers of Zul-Bha-Sair. Below the balcony of Phantamos the poet, the city did not sleep, but held its breath. It was the hour of the Procession, and the wide avenues, usually clotted with the indolent traffic of the city’s nobles, were unnervingly bare. A scent, not of decay but of cold dust and funereal spice, drifted up from the flagstones.

This was the core of life in Zul-Bha-Sair: the worship of Death, embodied by the god Mordiggian. And Mordiggian, it was said, was a fastidious deity.

From the obsidian temple at the city’s heart, the Procession began. Silent, black-robed bearers, their faces lost in shadow, carried a shrouded palanquin through the streets. They were the god’s Fingers, and within their silken bier lay the day’s Offering—some noble or merchant who had expired and was now being delivered not to the indignity of the earth, but to the honour of the divine gullet. The living of Zul-Bha-Sair did not bury their dead. They fed them to their god.

Phantamos watched, a cup of chilled wine from the vineyards of Yoros dangling from his slender fingers. He was a creature of wine-dark silks and weary elegance, his fame second only to that of the Tyrant and the God himself. Where the bearers of Mordiggian passed, the few onlookers pressed themselves flat against the walls in terrified reverence. But as they passed Phantamos’s villa, whispers slithered through the gloom, shaping his name. He was their other idol, the one who gave their grim faith its terrible beauty.

Tonight, his performance was at the manse of the Lady Ysadora, whose husband had been the star of the previous night’s Procession. There, surrounded by jaded aristocrats and professional mourners, Phantamos had given voice to history. His resonant, hypnotic chant had filled the hall, weaving a tale not of his own invention, but of Zothique’s bloody, voluminous past. He was a vessel, he claimed, for the agonies of ages.

He had recited “The Lament for the Amethyst Queen of Ustaim,” a classic of his repertoire. His voice had painted the scene of the queen’s final moments in her conquered throne room, two centuries gone.

*...Her pleas, a thread of smoke in winter air,  
Were lost on him, the conqueror from Naat.  
His fingers, deft as spiders in her hair,  
Prized the twelve amethysts her crown begat.  
He sought a treasure richer, rarer still,  
And with a thirteenth motion, cold and sly,  
He satisfied his soul-consuming will,  
And plucked the last gem from her dying eye...*

The recitation had been a triumph. The Lady Ysadora had wept, her sorrow made fashionable and exquisite by his art. Others, unnerved by the verse’s raw savagery, had merely poured more wine. For Phantamos, it was a familiar intoxication.

Now, back in the solitude of his chambers, the lotus-scented smoke curling around him, he felt the first chill of sobriety. He found it on his pillow of black silk. It had not been there when he left.

It was a small, velvet box. Such gifts were not uncommon; patrons often sent jewels or rare poisons in appreciation. His fingers, steady from years of holding an audience captive, untied the ribbon. He lifted the lid.

Lying on a bed of white satin was a single, flawless amethyst. It was the deep, violet-blue of a twilight sky, and it was still wet.

Phantamos leaned closer, his poet’s heart rate for once quickening with something other than artistic fervour. It was not wine that slicked the gem’s facets. A sliver of white sclera, threaded with a single, ruptured vein, clung to its edge.

He recoiled, his breath catching in his throat. He stumbled back, staring at the offering. It was a perfect echo of his verse. An admirer had sent him a rhyme written in flesh. His art, which had always kept a safe and beautiful distance from the world, had been answered by reality. And as the distant, holy silence of Mordiggian's temple once again settled over the city, Phantamos felt the first, true tremor of fear he had known in his life. His Muse had found a new collaborator.

Phantamos did not sleep. The amethyst, still nested in its velvet box, seemed to pulse in the gloom of his chamber like a malevolent star. He had pushed it to the far end of a long ebony table, but he could feel its presence, a cold spot in the lotus-scented air. His art, his shield and sustenance, had been turned into a weapon against him. A new quill felt alien in his hand, heavy with a terrible and unforeseen responsibility.

He could not be silent—that would be a victory for this murderous admirer. Nor could he continue in his usual vein. Every gory detail, every elegant atrocity he had ever penned now seemed like a loaded crossbow aimed at the heart of some unknown citizen of Zul-Bha-Sair. He must try to control the narrative, to steer his secret collaborator toward metaphor, away from the abattoir of the literal.

His next performance was three nights later, at the tenebrous palace of the Lord Vaarak, a man whose chief passions were morbid antiquities and the breeding of pale, sightless fish. The air was thick with the dust of sarcophagi and the musk of ancient waters. Phantamos, his face a mask of practiced composure, chose his new composition with care. He would speak of inanimate things, of sorrow cast in metal, not flesh.

His voice, a little less steady than he would have liked, filled the cavernous hall. He recited "The Grief of Gorguth," a verse about a long-forgotten hero immortalized in a monumental bronze statue, a monument so weathered and forgotten that it had begun to weep tears of black ichor for the ages it had outlasted.

*...No chronicle recalls his faded name,  
No living tongue speaks of his former fame.  
The hero's deeds are lost to sun and blight,  
His metal form stands lonely in the night.  
A bitter ichor from his eyes does seep,  
While all the careless, sleeping city sleep.  
These blackened drops for all the ages fall,  
A silent grief that covers and entombs all...*

The poem was met with confused murmurs. His audience was accustomed to blood and bone, to the poetry of the tomb. This tale of a weeping statue was too subtle, too melancholic. Lord Vaarak stroked one of his blind fish in its jade bowl and pronounced it "an interesting failure." Phantamos fled the palace, a cold sweat on his brow, hoping the sheer lack of violence in his verse would be enough.

He found his answer the next morning, delivered by the city's screaming gossips. Lycon, a sculptor of some renown and a bitter rival of Phantamos, had been found in his studio. He had been working on a commission for a new bronze bust of the Tyrant. The discovery was grotesque in its artistry. Lycon was not merely dead; he was the sculpture. His body, contorted in a silent scream, had been coated in the molten bronze from his own crucible. The metal had cooled, encasing him in a sarcophagus of his own art. And from the eye-sockets of the ghastly new statue, a foul, black liquid—a mixture of ichor and congealed blood—leaked in two thick streams down its burnished cheeks. The killer was not just literal; they were a critic with a cruel and inventive wit.

Panic, cold and absolute, now seized Phantamos. Metaphor had failed. He had given his muse a new canvas, and they had painted it with a masterpiece of horror. He had to retreat further, into the purely abstract. For his next recitation, he composed a frantic, almost incoherent piece titled "The King's Regret." It spoke of no object, no person, no place. It was a storm of pure emotion, of sorrow so profound it became a physical substance—a crimson dust that was the residue of a soul’s remorse.

He delivered it in a small, private salon, his voice trembling with genuine fear:

*...A sorrow born that has no shape or sound,  
A boundless grief that cannot be profound.  
A pain that aches within the spirit's heart,  
And tears the very soul and mind apart.  
This heavy weight becomes a crimson grain,  
A lasting mark of all-consuming pain.  
It is the dust of what he failed to be,  
The final end for all the world to see...*

This time, there was no applause at all, only the shifting of uncomfortable patrons. He had failed as a poet, but he prayed he had succeeded in giving his monster nothing to grasp.

Two days later, the merchant Kastor, a man whose vast wealth was matched only by his thinly veiled ambition to one day challenge the Tyrant, was found dead in his silken bed. There was not a mark on his body. Yet, when the priests of Mordiggian came to collect their offering, they found the corpse strangely light, brittle as a dried leaf. One of the bearers stumbled, and the body fell, shattering upon the marble floor. It crumbled into a heap of fine, crimson powder. An attending physician, a man versed in strange poisons, whispered that it appeared every drop of moisture had been leached from Kastor's body and replaced, vein by vein, with a mineral dust of unknown origin.

Phantamos heard the news and vomited into a potted fern. The killer was not just an artist; they were an alchemist, a magician. They could turn abstract concepts into physical reality.

He was cornered. Violence, metaphor, abstraction—all had led to death. There was one last path he could see, a desperate, final attempt to starve the beast. He would write of innocence. He would compose a verse so devoid of malice, so steeped in simple, natural beauty, that not even the most depraved imagination could twist it into an instrument of murder.

For a week, he locked himself away, refusing all invitations. He wrote and rewrote a single, short verse about the Silver-leafed Moon Lotus, a flower of legendary purity that grew only on the highest, most inaccessible cliffs of the Usk Mountains, blooming for a single night once a decade.

*...A hidden seed takes hold upon the stone,  
To face the wind and bitter frost alone.  
It drinks the starlight, frigid and so old,  
A silent story waiting to unfold.  
Its silver leaves unfurl before the sky,  
A perfect bloom that blossoms once to die.  
A fleeting gift of beauty, pure and bright,  
Then gone forever from the mortal sight...*

He did not perform this verse. He did not speak it aloud. He merely wrote it, pouring all his hope for peace into the ink. He left the parchment on his writing desk and fell into a haunted, exhausted sleep.

The next morning, it was there. Placed gently on the black silk pillow where the amethyst box had first appeared. A single, perfect Silver-leafed Moon Lotus. Its petals were the colour of moonlight on water, its leaves a soft, shimmering silver. It was impossible. The Usk Mountains were a week's journey away, their cliffs famously impassable. Yet here it was, fresh and pristine, a miracle of logistics and dedication.

For a moment, a sliver of hope pierced Phantamos’s terror. Perhaps this was the end. A simple offering of beauty for beauty. A sign of truce. With a trembling hand, he reached out and touched one of the delicate, silver petals, tilting the blossom toward him.

Curled within its perfect, moon-white heart, like a grotesque stamen, was a severed human tongue. It was still pink and wet. Phantamos recognized it instantly; he had seen it wagging in contempt only a month ago. It belonged to Sylana, the city’s most celebrated singer, who had loudly and publicly declared that Phantamos’s poetry was “the croaking of a gilded toad.”

The killer had not only proven that even innocence could be made a vessel for horror, but that they knew his world, his rivalries, his critics. This was not a distant admirer. This was someone close.

Phantamos stumbled back from the flower, his last hope dissolving into pure, unadulterated dread. He could not write his way out of this. He could not hide. His muse was not just a collaborator; it was a hunter. And its hunt was drawing ever closer to home.

For two days, Phantamos remained locked in his villa, the untouched wine sweating on his table. The path of the artist was closed to him. Every word he could write was now a potential death sentence. He had to find another way. The Tyrant's guard, with their lacquered armor and ceremonial spears, was useless. They were soldiers, not detectives, and they held the priesthood of Mordiggian in even greater awe than the common folk. To present them with a severed tongue inside a magical flower and claim it was an act of literary criticism would earn him a cell in the madhouse, not an investigation. These murders, with their alchemical artistry and ritualistic flair, bore the unmistakable fingerprint of the divine. Or, at least, of one of its most ardent followers.

The killer was no common assassin. They were a theologian of blood, a scholar of death. They were a priest. The thought settled in his gut, cold and heavy as a grave slab. His poetry, which he had always considered a secular entertainment, had been adopted as scripture by a fanatic.

There was only one place to find such a man: the Obsidian Temple, the cold heart of Zul-Bha-Sair. He, Phantamos, the idol of the city's salons, would have to walk into the spider's web.

He used his fame as his key. He sent a message to the temple, humbly announcing his intention to compose his magnum opus: a grand epic in honour of the Charnel God himself. To do so, he claimed, he required inspiration that could only be found within the temple's sacred walls. He requested an audience with the high priests, access to their archives, and a tour of the holy sanctums where the divine work was done.

The invitation was returned with unnerving speed. He was welcome.

The Obsidian Temple did not loom; it absorbed. It drank the dim sunlight and gave back nothing but a profound silence. The air inside was cold and still, scented with something older than dust—the faint, cloying perfume of centuries of offerings. Phantamos, feeling foolish and decadent in his wine-dark silks, was met not by the High Priest, but by a subordinate, a Master of the Holy Relics named Vorlag.

Vorlag was a man carved from bone. His flesh was stretched thin over a severe, angular frame, and his grey robes seemed to hang on him as they would a skeleton. But it was his eyes that held Phantamos captive. They were the colour of faded ink, and they burned with a terrifying, ecstatic light.

"The Poet," Vorlag breathed, his voice a dry rustle. He made no move to bow or offer a conventional greeting. Instead, his gaze devoured Phantamos. "We have been waiting for you. Your words have long been hymns in these hallowed halls. More honest than the droning of our elders."

As Vorlag led him through corridors of polished black stone, he spoke not of the temple's history, but of Phantamos's work. He quoted, verbatim, a dozen of the poet's most gruesome verses. He spoke of the Amethyst Queen as if he had been there, praising the "divine economy" of the act. He lauded the "terrible beauty" of the weeping bronze, and the "philosophical purity" of the merchant reduced to dust. He spoke of the recent deaths not as murders, but as "tributes" and "living poems."

"You see, great Phantamos," Vorlag whispered, his dry hand gripping the poet's arm with surprising strength. "You provide the sacred text. We, the humble servants of the god, merely provide the illustration."

Every word was a confirmation. Every quote, a confession. Phantamos felt his blood run cold. He was not speaking to a priest; he was speaking to his muse, to his collaborator, to his hunter. The man’s fanaticism was a physical force, an oppressive heat that warped the very air between them.

Phantamos feigned a deep, artistic gratitude, his actor's instincts taking over where his courage had fled. He asked banal questions about relics and rituals, his mind racing. He had found him. He had stared into the eyes of the man who had brought a tongue in a flower to his pillow.

As he finally took his leave, stepping out of the temple's oppressive silence and back into the dying, red light of the city, Phantamos felt no relief. He had succeeded. He had named the monster. But in seeking out the author of his ruin, he knew, with a certainty that chilled him more than any corpse, that he had just handed him the final chapter.

Phantamos did not go home. To return to his villa, with its now-violated solitude and terrible gifts, was unthinkable. Instead, he walked. He walked until the rouge-smear of the sun had been wiped from the sky, and the streets of Zul-Bha-Sair became a labyrinth of black ink. He found himself at a squalid tavern by the city’s edge, a place of scorched wine and broken men whose names were long forgotten. He, whose palate was accustomed to the finest vintages of Yoros, drank the foul liquid until his terror was replaced by a dull, throbbing numbness.

It was in that stupor that they came for him. They were not the black-robed Fingers of the God. They were shades, silent figures who detached themselves from the deeper shadows of the alley. There was no struggle. A cloth, smelling sweetly of crushed lotus and some heavier, soporific spice, was pressed over his face. His last thought was not of fear, but of the grim, artistic neatness of it all. Of course he would be taken with the same scent that had perfumed his own chambers. It was a signature.

He awoke on a cold stone slab. He was not bound. His silks were not even ruffled. He sat up, the drug leaving his head with a nauseous clarity. He was in a circular chamber, the walls seamless, curving up to a single, high aperture that showed a patch of star-dusted night sky. The air was frigid and utterly still. He was in the heart of the temple.

“I am pleased you are awake.” Vorlag’s voice echoed slightly in the stone drum. The priest was not there. “I feared the dose was too generous. Forgive the theatrics of your conveyance, but it would not do for the city to see its prophet arriving at the temple like a common criminal.”

Phantamos rose to his feet, circling the room. There was no door. “Vorlag\! Show yourself, you madman\!”

“Mad?” The voice was closer now. A section of the wall receded, revealing Vorlag standing in a dark passageway. He was holding a scroll of yellowed parchment. “No, great poet. I am the truest believer you have. You are a prophet. You speak the holy truths of our god, the terrible beauty of his hunger. You have given our faith its voice. Is it madness to honour that voice with tribute? To give your words the flesh they deserve?”

Phantamos stared at the scroll in the priest’s hand. He recognized it. The parchment, the feel of it in his memory, the way it curled at the edges. It was his. “What is that?” he asked, though he already knew.

“It is your masterpiece,” Vorlag said, his voice trembling with ecstatic reverence. “The one you have kept hidden from the world. Your magnum opus. I found it in your chambers tonight. Such a shame to keep it secret.”

He held up the scroll. ‘The Last Supper of the Worm.’ A poem Phantamos had written years ago, in a fever of youthful morbidity, a work so nihilistic and graphically horrific that even he had been sickened by it. He had locked it away, a secret shame. It detailed, in exquisite, anatomical verse, the slow, methodical consumption of a living man from the inside out by a sacred, divine parasite.

“All the others,” Vorlag said, his eyes gleaming, “the amethyst, the bronze, the dust, the tongue… they were merely preliminary sketches. Practice for the final performance. A tribute to your greatest, most secret work.”

He gestured around the bare stone room. “And you, Prophet, shall be the centerpiece. You shall be the living parchment upon which your final, greatest verse is written.” Vorlag stepped back into the shadows. "The god is hungry. And tonight, he will feast on poetry made real."

The stone wall slid shut, leaving Phantamos in the cold, silent dark. The only sound was his own frantic breathing. This was the end. His own dark imagination, twisted into a weapon by a madman, would be his tomb. He was a poet, a creature of words and wine, not a hero. What could he do? He sank to his knees on the freezing stone, a sob of despair catching in his throat.

And then, he heard it. The scraping sound of Vorlag unrolling the parchment outside the hidden door. The priest began to chant, his voice a low hum, reciting the opening lines of ‘The Last Supper of the Worm.’ Hearing his own foul words from his executioner's mouth was a final, surreal horror.

But as the priest’s voice droned on, a strange thing happened. The terror in Phantamos’s heart did not lessen, but it changed. It was honed, sharpened by a sudden, defiant rage. Rage at Vorlag, for his grotesque, fawning madness. Rage at himself, for the vanity and blindness that had led him here. And rage at the cheap, theatrical violence that the priest mistook for divinity.

Vorlag thought Mordiggian was a god of bloody spectacle. He had missed the point entirely. The true horror of the Charnel God, the truth that every citizen of Zul-Bha-Sair understood in their bones, was not in the dramatic flourish. It was in the silence. The waiting. Complete, passive, unavoidable consumption.

His mind, which had been a whirlwind of panic, suddenly became still and clear. An idea, born of desperation and revelation, took shape. He had one weapon left. His voice. He would not plead. He would not scream. He would compose.

“You are a fool, Vorlag\!” Phantamos’s voice, no longer trembling, rang out, resonant and powerful, cutting through the priest’s chanting.

The chanting stopped. There was a moment of silence. “The prophet speaks,” Vorlag’s voice answered, laced with smug piety. “A final verse before the sacrament?”

“I speak to correct a groveling amateur,” Phantamos called out, pushing himself to his feet. His fear was still there, a cold knot in his stomach, but it was now fuel. “You splash in blood and call it art. You arrange guts and call it theology. You are a noisy, arrogant child playing with his father’s tools, and you have understood nothing of the god you claim to serve\!”

He did not wait for a reply. He closed his eyes, drew a deep breath, and began to improvise, his voice falling into the familiar, hypnotic cadence of his performances. But the words were new, forged in the crucible of his terror.

*...You think our god is in the snapping bone?  
The frantic plea, the final, weeping groan?  
You think he savors theatrical display,  
The garish horrors of your clumsy play?  
These are but echoes, priest, a gaudy show,  
For fearful men who do not wish to know...*

He paused, letting the words hang in the stone chamber. He could feel Vorlag’s stunned silence on the other side of the wall. He continued, his voice dropping, becoming more intimate, more chilling.

*...The god is not the storm that shrieks and kills,  
He is the silence in the waiting hills.  
He is not the worm that writhes in fevered lust,  
He is the patient, all-consuming dust.  
He does not need your gifts of blood and pain,  
He is the slow, inevitable rain,  
That wears the mountain to a grain of sand,  
And takes the tyrant’s crown and grasping hand...*

Another pause. The air in the chamber felt thick, heavy with portent.

*...Your noisy murders are a blasphemy,  
An insult to his vast serenity.  
You scream for his attention with your knife,  
While he is in the stillness after life.  
He is the void where all our passions cease,  
The perfect, final, all-absorbing peace.  
You have not served him. You have made him weep,  
By waking him from his eternal sleep.*

The final words faded into the absolute silence of the chamber. Phantamos stood in the dark, his body trembling with the effort, his throat raw. He had thrown his final, desperate rhyme into the void. There was a long, terrible pause. Then, he heard a sound from beyond the wall. It was not a cry of rage or a triumphant laugh. It was a choked, confused sob. Vorlag’s fanatical certainty, the very bedrock of his being, had been shattered.

The sob was cut short by a soundless pressure that filled the room. It was not a noise, but the cessation of all noise. The air became thick, viscous, and unnaturally cold. The small aperture high above, showing the indifferent stars, went black. Not as if covered, but as if the very concept of light had been erased from that patch of sky. Phantamos felt an ancient, primal terror that had nothing to do with Vorlag or his knives. This was the fear of the mouse in the instant before the owl strikes, the fear of the atom before it is swallowed by the void.

The stone wall slid open.

Vorlag stood there, his face a mask of utter devastation, tears cutting clean paths through the grime on his cheeks. The scroll of Phantamos’s secret poem lay at his feet. But the priest was no longer the threat. He was no longer even the focus. He was simply the nearest object to a newly opened door.

Behind him, the passageway was filled with a shadow that was not a shadow. It was a presence defined by its absolute absence. It did not have a shape, but it had a form, a writhing, amorphous bulk that seemed to be made of coagulated silence. It was blacker than the temple obsidian, blacker than the starless sky above. It was the colour of the universe’s final moments.

It was Mordiggian.

The god, drawn from his eternal slumber by the blasphemous noise of Vorlag’s theatricals and the profound truth of Phantamos’s final verse, had come to investigate the disturbance.

The Charnel God did not look at Phantamos. The poet, the cause of it all, was as insignificant as a fleck of dust. The divine presence was focused entirely on the priest who had dared to make so much noise in his name. Vorlag stared into the silent, churning void, his eyes wide with a terror so complete it was almost beatific. He opened his mouth, perhaps to scream, perhaps to pray, perhaps to offer one last, pathetic defense.

No sound came out. No sound could.

The silence flowed over him. It did not touch him, yet his grey robes began to darken and fray, dissolving like smoke. His skin, stretched taut over his bones, seemed to grow translucent, then faded to nothing. His skeleton, for a bare instant, stood pristine and white against the absolute black, a final, perfect offering. And then it too was gone, unmade, consumed not by a gullet but by a negation.

Vorlag, his fanaticism, his murders, his very existence, were erased from the world. There was no blood, no scream, no sign of violence. It was a silent, effortless, and utterly complete act of consumption.

The shadow, the void, the god, retreated, flowing back into the passageways of the temple as silently as it had arrived. The stars reappeared in the aperture above. The pressure in the air vanished. The only evidence that anything had happened was the yellowed scroll lying on the floor of the empty corridor.

Phantamos did not move for a long time. The door to his prison remained open. He was free. He walked out of the chamber, his wine-dark silks seeming garish and absurd in the solemn quiet of the temple. He did not look back. He walked through the obsidian corridors, past relics and altars, and out the great temple doors into the predawn gloom of Zul-Bha-Sair.

His life had been spared, but his spirit was annihilated. His art, the thing he had loved above all else, was a venomous power he could no longer control. He had looked upon the face of his god and seen the ultimate truth: that to a being of infinite silence, a poet’s words are the most obscene noise of all.

He never returned to his villa. He did not collect his jewels or his library of rare poisons. He walked out of the city gates as the red sun began to bleed once more upon the horizon, a man with no name and no craft. He fled Zul-Bha-Sair, and the last of the great poets of Zothique was never heard from again, forever silenced by the terrible, sublime horror of a prayer that had been answered.

The End.
