*Her final tears began to stream,*

*A blasphemy of perfect grace;*

*A masterwork she can't deface,*

*The nightmare of an artist's dream.*

The sun, that ancient ruby bled of its fire, hung like a clot above the spires of Cimpala. In that final metropolis of a dying world, where even the shadows seemed weary, Calantha worked her loom. She was a weaver of funerary tapestries, her threads catching the last glimmers of legends and the somber hues of passings long forgotten. But no thread could capture the horror she found in the studio of her lover, Phanes.

He lay not in the squalor of some common death, but in a state of dreadful peace. Phanes, the sculptor whose genius was a fever, was sprawled before an unfinished monolith of basalt, a chisel still loose in his grasp. Upon his face was a look of such sublime and rapturous revelation that Calantha felt a blasphemous envy. It was the look of a man who had stared into the ultimate abyss and found it beautiful. Clutched in his other hand, an affront to the sun-scorched earth of Zothique, was a single, impossibly perfect black lily, its petals like carved pieces of night.

The city guard, men whose ancestors had witnessed the fall of empires and the birth of monstrous gods, gave the scene a cursory glance. “A death by divine visitation,” their captain grunted, the words worn smooth by a thousand other inexplicable demises. The case was closed. For Calantha, it had just opened. The memory of that ecstatic visage and the mystery of the tenebrous flower became a cancer in her soul, a maddening obsession that grief alone could not sustain. She had to understand.

Her inquiries took her from the silent towers of the nobles to the stinking warrens of the city's underbelly. In the spice market, amid the funereal perfumes of cinnamon and myrrh and other odours for which no name exists, her persistence found purchase. A wizened merchant, his skin the colour of aged parchment, recognized her description of the lily. For a purse heavy with her last silver, he leaned close, his breath a foul wind from a forgotten tomb.

“There are whispers,” he hissed, “of Lord Pharumm, the Curator. They say he tends a garden hidden in the Mountains of the Dead, a place where death itself is cultivated as the ultimate art. They say he grows flowers from the soil of final, perfect moments.”

The name fell upon Calantha’s heart like a slab of granite. With this terrifying, singular lead, she returned to her quarters, sold her loom and its precious tapestries, and with the grim proceeds, set out for the desolate mountains that loomed like skeletal fingers against the horizon.

Her journey was a pilgrimage through a world in its death throes. She left the relative shelter of Cimpala to follow the ghost of an imperial highway, its cyclopean flagstones fractured and swallowed by seas of ochre sand. Days were spent under the heat of the baleful sun, nights under a canopy of alien constellations whose light was cold and menacing. She passed the crumbling vermilion ruins of cities whose names were no longer remembered, their towers standing like the broken teeth of a colossal skull. In the shadow of one such ruin, she saw a family of gaunt scavengers gnawing on the fibrous root of some foul, leafless plant. They watched her pass with eyes devoid of anything but hunger, and she clutched the purse of silver at her belt and hurried on.

Further on, she witnessed a procession of pilgrims, their bodies scourged and emaciated, crawling on their knees toward a forgotten shrine where the god had long since died of neglect. The bleached bones of monstrous, ancient beasts, half-buried in the shifting dunes, served as milestones for her grim progress. The merciless heat and the unending vista of decay scoured her soul. The soft, aching grief for Phanes was burned away, flaking off her like sun-scorched skin. In its place, something harder grew: a crystalline, desperate resolve, an obsession as stark and unyielding as the landscape around her. The world was a corpse, and she was but a maggot crawling with singular purpose across its flesh.

She found the entrance not by map or sign, but by its scent: a faint, cloyingly sweet miasma of asphodel and decay that leaked from a nearly invisible fissure in a sheer rock face. She stepped through, and the sighing of the wind ceased. A dim, ruddy light, like that which filters through a chalice of old wine, illuminated a place of profound and ordered morbidity. Petrified, leafless trees formed a canopy above. The path that crunched softly under her sandals was made of polished, crushed vertebrae.

At the heart of this silent demesne, she met its master. Lord Pharumm was a thing of impossible age, his skin like time-thinned vellum stretched over a delicate frame of bone. He moved with a noiseless grace, and his eyes held the detached, appreciative glint of a connoisseur examining a rare gem as he listened to her quest.

“Ah, the sculptor,” Pharumm stated, his voice a dry rustle of dead leaves. “His final moment was… exquisite. A flawless acquisition. It is, in fact, the newest jewel in my collection.”

Desperate, Calantha pleaded to see it. Pharumm smiled, a bloodless parting of his thin lips. He was intrigued by her artisan's devotion, the raw material of a fine obsession.

“The price for such a viewing is not paid in coin,” he said. “For one full cycle of the moon, you will serve as my assistant. You will tend the garden. If your work proves satisfactory, you shall have your private viewing.”

With no other path to take, Calantha agreed.

Her tutelage was a series of silent, repulsive tasks. She polished a spectral dagger in a kneeling king’s back, the chill of the solidified shadow seeping into her own hands. At first, she wept in frustration and sorrow, but her tears were a required ingredient in the polishing oils. Soon, her weeping became a mechanical act, and she found herself focusing on the cruel, perfect line of the phantom blade, wondering at the artistry required to capture not an act, but the pure essence of its motive.

She tended the King Who Wept Jewels, a monarch whose eternal avarice bled from him as flawed, cloudy gems. Her task was to grind these into a glittering dust. The grating sound set her teeth on edge, and the dust felt like failure itself clinging to her skin. Yet as she scattered it as fertilizer for the grey, ghostly flowers at his feet, she saw in the swirling patterns a tapestry of ruin, a design as intricate and complete as any she had ever woven. Her own grief felt similarly useless, a treasure of sorrow that fed nothing.

She was forced to chisel imperfections from the Lovers of Tsur, two figures petrifying into a single pillar of obsidian. The sound of her mallet and chisel was the only sound in the suffocating silence of their embrace. She saw in their fused forms the echo of her own possessive love for Phanes—the desire to hold on so tightly that both identities dissolved. Was this love, or was it a prison built for two? The question was a splinter in her mind as she worked to perfect the lines of their shared doom.

The transformation took root when she tended the Last Warrior. As she pruned salt-like crystals of rage from his wounds, she cut her hand. A drop of her blood fell upon him, and for a blinding second, she was inundated with his unending exhaustion and a fury so profound it had become a law of nature. The shock threw her back, but as she gasped for breath, the horror was joined by a new, terrible clarity. The warrior was not a man in pain; he was a monument to defiance itself. Her horror was not gone, but it was now accompanied by a strange, perverse aesthetic appreciation. The composition was perfect. Her transformation was nearly complete.

Her service done, a satisfied Lord Pharumm led her through a grove of weeping cypress to the very heart of his garden. There, in a secluded grotto, she found Phanes.

He stood before an unfinished block of basalt, chisel in hand, his head thrown back in a silent, unending cry of pure, creative ecstasy. The vibrant, impossible black lily bloomed from the center of his chest, its dark roots intertwined with the petrified veins beneath his skin. He was not dead. He was eternal.

“I was his patron,” Pharumm murmured, his voice less an explanation than a shared confidence between artists. “An obsession like his is a rare medium. He did not seek fame, or wealth. He sought the kind of beauty that burns away the soul that perceives it. I merely opened the door to the final gallery.”

Calantha stared, her mind a maelstrom of horror and awe. “But… the body… I found him…”

Pharumm gave a slight, dismissive wave of his hand. “An echo. A courtesy to the ephemeral world, which demands such things. A shell for the weavers of funerary rites to fuss over. But the art… the *moment*… that is what is real. That is what endures.”

Calantha stood before the effigy of the man she had loved. A primal wave of revulsion washed over her, a desire to bring a sledgehammer down upon this grotesque statue and grant Phanes the simple peace of oblivion. This was a violation, a blasphemy against memory itself. Her hands clenched, her knuckles white.

But she was a weaver. She could not stop her eyes from tracing the lines of his form—the tautness of the muscle in his arm, the sublime curve of his neck, the perfect tension in his jaw. It was a composition of pure, unadulterated rapture. The black lily was not an intrusion but a focal point, the dark, vibrant heart from which the entire piece drew its terrible power. Her mind screamed in protest, but her artisan’s soul, newly educated in this dreadful garden, saw the truth of it. This was not a prison. This was his masterwork. To destroy it would be to vandalize a piece of art so perfect it could never be made again. It would be an act born of her fading grief, not his eternal will.

Tears, no longer of sorrow but of a terrible, crystalline understanding, streamed down her face. She reached out a trembling hand and touched the cold basalt Phanes was sculpting, feeling the lingering, ecstatic energy thrumming within the stone. Her love for the man warred with her awe for the artist, and the battle was already lost.

“It is beautiful,” she whispered, the words tasting of ash and starlight.

As she departed that macabre paradise, stepping from its silent twilight back into the dying red glare of Zothique, Lord Pharumm placed something small and hard in her hand. It was a single, black, pearl-like seed from the lily that bloomed on Phanes’ chest.

“For your own garden,” the necromancer murmured. “Should you ever find a memory worth preserving.”

Calantha closed her hand around the seed. She did not look back. Her future was a blank and terrible tapestry, and for the first time, she felt the desire to weave it.

The End.
