# The Garden of Final Moments

**Synopsis**

In the moribund world of Zothique, where the sun bleeds crimson and shadows languish in their own exhaustion, Calantha weaves funerary tapestries to capture the phosphorescence of fading legends. When her lover, the sculptor Phanes, is discovered deceased in a posture of rapturous revelation, clutching a sinister lily of absolute blackness, her grief transmutes into obsession. Compelled to unravel the enigma of his passing, Calantha ventures from the spires of Cimpala to the desolate Mountains of the Dead, where whispers speak of Lord Pharumm: a curator of death's ultimate aesthetic who tends a hidden garden where moments are cultivated as one tends rare and poisonous blooms. To gain access to the truth about Phanes' final moment, she must serve as Pharumm's assistant for one lunar cycle, tending his macabre collection of petrified souls frozen in their ultimate expressions of ecstasy, avarice, rage, and despair. As she polishes spectral daggers, grinds jeweled tears, and chips away imperfections from lovers fused into obsidian, Calantha's grief slowly transforms into something far more dangerous: an aesthetic appreciation for the terrible perfection of death itself.

*Her final tears began to stream,*  
*A blasphemy of perfect grace;*  
*A masterwork she can't deface,*  
*The nightmare of an artist's dream.*

The sun, that ancient ruby bled of its primordial fire, hung like a pustulent clot above the spires of Cimpala. In that ultimate metropolis of a world given over to its long dying, where even the shadows themselves seemed wearied unto extinction, Calantha pursued her melancholy craft at the loom. She was a weaver of funerary tapestries, her threads ensnaring the last coruscations of legends and the sepulchral hues of passings long consigned to oblivion's dusty archives. Yet no thread in her possession, no matter how cunningly wrought, could capture the horror she discovered in the studio of her lover, Phanes.

He lay not in the squalor of some common dissolution, but in a state of peace most dreadful to behold. Phanes, that sculptor whose genius was as a fever consuming him from within, was sprawled before an unfinished monolith of basalt, a chisel still loose within his grasp. Upon his countenance was wrought a look of such sublime and rapturous revelation that Calantha felt a blasphemous envy kindle within her breast. It was the expression of one who had stared into the ultimate abyss and found therein a beauty beyond all mortal comprehension. Clutched in his other hand, an affront to the sun-scorched earth of Zothique itself, was a single, impossibly perfect black lily: its petals like carved fragments of primordial night, edges gleaming with an opaline sheen.

The city guard (men whose ancestors had witnessed the fall of empires and the nativity of monstrous gods) gave the scene a cursory examination. "A death by divine visitation," their captain grunted, the words worn smooth by a thousand other inexplicable demises. The case was closed with bureaucratic finality. For Calantha, it had but just opened. The memory of that ecstatic visage and the mystery of the tenebrous flower became a carcinoma in her soul, a maddening obsession that grief alone could not sustain. She must needs understand.

Her inquiries took her from the silent towers of the nobles to the stinking warrens of the city's underbelly. In the spice market, amid the funereal perfumes of cinnamon and myrrh and other aromatic essences for which no nomenclature exists in any known tongue, her persistence found purchase at last. A wizened merchant, his integument the colour of aged parchment left too long in sepulchral vaults, recognized her description of the lily. For a purse heavy with her last silver, he leaned close, his breath a foul miasma from some forgotten tomb.

"There are whispers," he hissed, his voice scarcely audible above the market's drone, "of Lord Pharumm, the Curator. They say he tends a garden hidden in the Mountains of the Dead: a place where death itself is cultivated as the ultimate aesthetic. They say he grows flowers from the soil of final, perfect moments."

The name fell upon Calantha's heart like a slab of funereal granite. With this terrifying, singular lead, she returned to her quarters, sold her loom and its precious tapestries (the work of years), and with the grim proceeds thus obtained, set forth for the desolate mountains that loomed like skeletal fingers against the horizon's bleeding edge - a vista of carnelian and rust.

Her journey was a pilgrimage through a world in its ultimate death throes. She abandoned the relative shelter of Cimpala to follow the ghost of an imperial highway: its cyclopean flagstones fractured and swallowed by seas of ochre sand. Days were spent beneath the heat of the baleful sun, nights beneath a canopy of alien constellations whose light was cold and menacing as the gaze of distant, malevolent gods. She passed the crumbling vermilion ruins of cities whose names were no longer remembered by even the eldest of scholars, their towers standing like the broken teeth of some colossal skull. In the shadow of one such ruin, she espied a family of gaunt scavengers gnawing upon the fibrous root of some foul, leafless plant. They watched her pass with eyes devoid of aught save hunger, and she clutched the purse of silver at her belt and hastened onward.

Further along her dolorous route, she witnessed a procession of pilgrims: their bodies scourged and emaciated, crawling upon their knees toward a forgotten shrine where the god had long since perished of neglect. The bleached bones of monstrous, ancient beasts, half-buried in the shifting dunes, served as milestones for her grim progress. The merciless heat and the unending vista of decay scoured her soul with the thoroughness of a desert wind. The soft, aching grief for Phanes was burned away, flaking from her like sun-scorched skin. In its place, something harder crystallized: a desperate resolve as stark and unyielding as the landscape surrounding her. The world was a corpse, and she was but a maggot crawling with singular purpose across its putrefying flesh.

She found the entrance not by map or sign, but by its scent: a faint, cloyingly sweet miasma of asphodel and decay that leaked from a nearly invisible fissure in a sheer rock face. She stepped through that narrow aperture, and the sighing of the wind ceased utterly. A dim, ruddy light (like that which filters through a chalice of ancient wine, or through the translucent depths of a bloodstone) illuminated a place of profound and ordered morbidity. Petrified, leafless trees formed a canopy above, their branches interlocking like the fingers of skeletal hands in prayer. The path that crunched softly beneath her sandals was composed of polished, crushed vertebrae.

At the heart of this silent demesne, she met its master. Lord Pharumm was a thing of impossible antiquity, his skin like time-thinned vellum stretched over a delicate frame of bone. His eyes were the color of smoky topaz, holding depths of amber patience accumulated through aeons. He moved with a noiseless grace that spoke of centuries of practice, and his eyes held the detached, appreciative glint of a connoisseur examining a rare and flawless gem as he listened to the recounting of her quest.

"Ah, the sculptor," Pharumm stated, his voice a dry rustle of dead leaves stirred by autumn winds long past. "His final moment was of an exquisiteness beyond measure. A flawless acquisition. It is, in point of fact, the newest jewel in my collection."

Desperate beyond all caution, Calantha pleaded to see it. Pharumm smiled: a bloodless parting of his thin lips. He was intrigued by her artisan's devotion, recognizing in her the raw material of a fine obsession.

"The price for such a viewing is not paid in coin," he said with deliberate slowness. "For one full cycle of the moon, you will serve as my assistant. You will tend the garden with all the care it demands. If your work proves satisfactory, you shall have your private viewing."

With no other path open to her, Calantha agreed to his terms.

Her tutelage was a series of silent, repulsive tasks that tested the boundaries of her endurance. She polished a spectral dagger embedded in a kneeling king's back: the chill of the solidified shadow seeping into her own hands like a contagion. At first, she wept in frustration and sorrow, but her tears were a required ingredient in the polishing oils. Soon, her weeping became a mechanical act devoid of genuine emotion, and she found herself focusing on the cruel, perfect line of the phantom blade, wondering at the artistry required to capture not an act, but the pure essence of its motive.

She tended the King Who Wept Jewels: a monarch whose eternal avarice bled from him as flawed, cloudy gems - malformed diamonds, cracked emeralds, and opals whose fire had died to a sickly iridescence. Her task was to grind these into a glittering dust. The grating sound set her teeth on edge, and the dust felt like failure itself clinging to her skin with unwholesome persistence. Yet as she scattered it as fertilizer for the grey, ghostly flowers at his feet, she perceived in the swirling patterns a tapestry of ruin: a design as intricate and complete as any she had ever woven. Her own grief felt similarly useless, a treasure of sorrow that nourished nothing.

She was compelled to chisel imperfections from the Lovers of Tsur: two figures petrifying into a single pillar of obsidian, their flesh transmuting to volcanic glass with veins of garnet running through like frozen blood. The sound of her mallet and chisel was the only sound in the suffocating silence of their eternal embrace. She saw in their fused forms the echo of her own possessive love for Phanes: the desire to hold on so tightly that both identities dissolved into a singular, suffocating unity. Was this love, or was it a prison built for two? The question was a splinter in her mind as she labored to perfect the lines of their shared doom.

The transformation took root when she tended the Last Warrior. As she pruned salt-like crystals of rage from his wounds, she cut her hand upon a particularly sharp outcropping. A drop of her blood fell upon him, and for a blinding second, she was inundated with his unending exhaustion and a fury so profound it had become a law of nature itself. The shock threw her backward, but as she gasped for breath, the horror was joined by a new, terrible clarity. The warrior was not a man in pain; he was a monument to defiance itself, a sculpture of will made manifest. Her horror was not gone, but it was now accompanied by a strange, perverse aesthetic appreciation. The composition was perfect in its awfulness. Her transformation was nearly complete.

Her service done at last, a satisfied Lord Pharumm led her through a grove of weeping cypress to the very heart of his garden. There, in a secluded grotto where the ruddy light seemed to thicken into a palpable presence, she found Phanes.

He stood before an unfinished block of basalt, chisel in hand, his head thrown back in a silent, unending cry of pure, creative ecstasy. The vibrant, impossible black lily bloomed from the center of his chest: its dark roots intertwined with the petrified veins beneath his skin, each petal edged with a subtle fire like black opal catching light from within. He was not dead. He was eternal.

"I was his patron," Pharumm murmured, his voice less an explanation than a shared confidence between artists. "An obsession such as his is a rare medium indeed. He did not seek fame, or wealth, or any of the petty baubles that motivate lesser souls. He sought the kind of beauty that burns away the very soul that perceives it. I merely opened the door to the final gallery."

Calantha stared, her mind a maelstrom of horror and awe competing for dominance. "But... the body... I found him..."

Pharumm gave a slight, dismissive wave of his skeletal hand. "An echo. A courtesy to the ephemeral world, which demands such things for its rituals and lamentations. A shell for the weavers of funerary rites to fuss over. But the art... the *moment*... that is what possesses reality. That is what endures beyond the dying of suns."

Calantha stood before the effigy of the man she had loved with all the passion her soul could contain. A primal wave of revulsion washed over her: a desire to bring a sledgehammer down upon this grotesque statue and grant Phanes the simple peace of oblivion. This was a violation, a blasphemy against memory itself. Her hands clenched, her knuckles white with the force of her suppressed fury.

But she was a weaver. She could not stop her eyes from tracing the lines of his form: the tautness of the muscle in his arm, the sublime curve of his neck, the perfect tension in his jaw. It was a composition of pure, unadulterated rapture. The black lily was not an intrusion but a focal point: the dark, vibrant heart from which the entire piece drew its terrible power. Her mind screamed in protest, but her artisan's soul (newly educated in the aesthetic of this dreadful garden) saw the truth of it. This was not a prison. This was his masterwork. To destroy it would be to vandalize a piece of art so perfect it could never be wrought again. It would be an act born of her fading grief, not his eternal will.

Tears (no longer of sorrow but of a terrible, crystalline understanding - each one a perfect sphere of anguish cut as precisely as a jeweler's cabochon) streamed down her face. She reached out a trembling hand and touched the cold basalt Phanes was sculpting, feeling the lingering, ecstatic energy thrumming within the stone like a heartbeat. Her love for the man warred with her awe for the artist, and the battle was already lost.

"It is beautiful," she whispered, the words tasting of ash and starlight.

As she departed that macabre paradise, stepping from its silent twilight back into the dying red glare of Zothique, Lord Pharumm placed something small and hard in her hand. It was a single, black, pearl-like seed from the lily that bloomed upon Phanes' chest.

"For your own garden," the necromancer murmured with the faintest suggestion of approval. "Should you ever find a memory worth preserving."

Calantha closed her hand around the seed. She did not look back. Her future was a blank and terrible tapestry, and for the first time since Phanes' death, she felt the desire to weave it.

The End.
